<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THIS little book is divided into two parts. The First Department
is the children's very own. It is for them to study under the
guidance of teacher, mother, brother, or sister. It has been
prepared with great care by one who has had many years' experience
as a teacher of children.</div>

<p>The Second Department is for the entertainment of children both
young and old. Its lessons are taken from God's Word. While the
children are learning to read from the "Easy Lesson" department,
let the parents and older brothers and sisters read to them the Bible
stories which follow, showing and explaining to them the beautiful
pictures which accompany them. Lessons taught in this manner will
never be forgotten.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">To Teachers and Parents.</span></h3>

<p>God speaks to us through His Word, by His Spirit, and through
nature. By interesting children in nature, which is all about them, it
is hoped they will find pleasure in studying God's open book, and thus
be led to love and study His written Word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackboard Teaching.</span>&mdash;The crayon and the blackboard are
very essential in the work with children. Let the first lessons be given
in script from the blackboard. The simple sentences may be drawn
from the child by questioning. Then tell the child that you will write
what he has said. Then ask, "Now can you read it?" The lesson
should be about some thing which the child can see, and in which he
is interested.</p>

<p>For a review lesson, if the idiom, "I see," has been learned,
many sentences may be made by drawing the objects, as "I see a *"
(here draw a leaf or some other object). Use the idioms, "I have,"
"This is," etc., in the same way. The earlier lessons in this book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
should be largely supplemented from the blackboard in this way, or
by variation of the different sentences.</p>

<p>From the first let the children write on the board, where there
can be free movement of the arm. Original work should be aimed
at from the start. The child soon learns to write the idiom, "I
see;" then he is prepared to do original work on the board or on
paper. The blackboard work on page 33 is suggestive of what may
be done in original work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sentence Reading.</span>&mdash;The words of a sentence should not be
read separately. At first the sentences are short, and the words are
soon easily known at sight. Until the thought is known, the sentence
should not be read aloud. Hence silent reading should always precede
oral reading with children. "<i>Read as you talk</i>," is a good rule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Writing.</span>&mdash;The script capitals and small letters on page 6 are for
reference. The letters are not to be written separately, but to be used
in words. For practice in writing, use the simple sentences found in
the lessons. If written <i>many times</i>, the words will be memorized, and
can be used in original work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drawing.</span>&mdash;Allow free hand drawing. Use outline drawings of
objects, as on pages 13 and 49. Lay sticks, then draw them. Provide
children with sticks of different lengths. The kindergarten colored
sticks are best. They are inexpensive, and can be used in many ways.</p>

<p>Encourage picture illustrations of simple stories. Also the illustration
of Bible lessons. Many or all of them may be crude, but
thoughts are expressed, and the lesson more deeply impressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reviews.</span>&mdash;Observe the suggestion about silent reading first. If
the thought is not easily gotten, the words are not familiar&mdash;not well
learned. The child should use the words many times. As reiteration
is the only way in which words are learned through the ear, so it is
the only way they are learned through the eye. The use of the blackboard
is an invaluable help in making impressions through the eye.</p>

<p>He said that a man sowed
some good seed in a field. Then
some one came and sowed tares
in the same field. The good seed was
wheat.</p>

<p>So the wheat and tares were growing

<p class="dropcapstory"><span class="bgcolor">SATAN</span> was once a beautiful, powerful
angel in Heaven. His name then
was Lucifer, which means, "Son of the Morning,"
or, "Shining One, Son of the Dawn." His position
in Heaven, his beauty, power, and final end,
are well described in Ezekiel 28:12-19.</p>

<p>Lucifer, or Satan, is, next to God and Christ, the
wisest being in the universe, for God said, "Thou sealest up
the sum, full of wisdom." Verse 12.</p>

<p>He was a very beautiful being, for the text says he was
"perfect in beauty." Verse 12.</p>

<p>He has been in the Eden home of Adam and Eve. "Thou
hast been in the garden of God." Verse 13.</p>

<p>He was a great musician, and doubtless led the music and
singing of the hosts of angels in their morning and evening
songs of praise to God. Verse 13 says, "The workmanship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the
day that thou wast created."</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 221px;">
<img src="images/illus059.jpg" width="221" height="453" alt="Satan as an angel" />
<div class="caption">Lucifer after the Fall.<br />"Prince of the power of the air."</div>
</div>
<p>The above text shows that he was "created" by the power
of God. All the angels were created full grown, and not
born as children. Hence this text is describing some heavenly
being.</p>

<p>"Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have
set thee so." Verse 14. Lucifer's position was by the throne
of God, with his wings outstretched above it.</p>

<p>The ark built by Moses was a type of heavenly things.
On the top of this ark were two cherubim with their wings
covering the ark where the glory of God rested. See Exodus
25:20. This represents Lucifer's position as covering cherub,
close to the throne of God in heaven.</p>

<p>Lucifer was "the anointed cherub." Anciently the prophets
of the Lord anointed the kings to show that they were
appointed of God to govern and command. Lucifer was, next
to the Son of God, the anointed commander of the hosts of
heavenly angels.</p>

<p>All his wisdom, beauty, power, and position were given
him by God who had created him. The Creator fitted him
for the work He wished him to do, and the place He desired
him to occupy. Lucifer owed everything which he possessed
to his Lord.</p>

<p>But, like some people who have riches and power, he become
proud of his glory. He forgot that it was all the gift
of God. The text says, "Thine heart was lifted up because
of thy beauty." Eze. 28:17.</p>

<p>The Son of God was above him, and equal with His
Father. Lucifer was second to Christ; but, considering his
beauty and power, he decided that he ought to be equal with
God.</p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah says of him, "Thou hast said in thine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
heart, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will
be like the Most High." Chapter 14:13, 14.</p>

<p>But Jehovah could not permit this. The very thought of
it by Lucifer was sin, for it was
pride and the exaltation of self.
Only the Son of God could be equal
with the Father.</p>

<p>Then rebellion came into the
heart of Lucifer. He went among
the angels and told his story. They
loved him as their leader, and many
took sides with him.</p>

<p>The loyalty of all the angels
was tested. Nearly one-half their
number took sides with Lucifer.
Then there was open rebellion in
Heaven. Lucifer had a vast army
at his command, and he felt strong
enough to defy God.</p>

<p>But rebellion could not be allowed
in Heaven. The rebel host
must be disposed of in some way.
God could destroy them at once,
for if He could create them He
could also destroy them.</p>

<p>But Lucifer had charged God
with being partial and severe, and
claimed that the laws of Jehovah
were not needed in Heaven. So
God allowed the rebellion to develop
and do its work, that all the universe might see the
awful results of sin, and the final fate of sinners. This will
be an object lesson through all eternity.</p>



<div class='note'>
<p><span class='smcap'>Note.</span>&mdash;The twenty-eighth chapter of Ezekiel tells of the overthrow of the prince of Tyrus,
or the city of Tyre, which was a very strong, wealthy, proud, and wicked city on the Mediterranean
Sea, near Palestine.</p>
<p>But by reading verses 12-15, it will be seen that this chapter has a double application, and
that these verses refer more especially to some being standing at one time in a high position
in heaven. It shows him to have been very wise, beautiful, and powerful, and near the presence
of the Almighty God.</p>
<p>Such a description can apply only to Lucifer, now known as the devil, and Satan, described
in the accompanying lesson. The Bible is full of object lessons; and kingdoms, men, and events
are often taken to teach important lessons. Christ did much of His teaching by parables. He
took things as He found them in the world to illustrate and make forcible great Gospel
truths.</p>
<p>In this chapter the power and beauty, the pride and wickedness, and the final overthrow
of Tyre were taken to represent the high position of Lucifer in heaven, his sin of pride and rebellion,
and his final fall.</p></div>

<p class='dropcapstory2'><span class='bgcolor'>LUCIFER</span> and his angels had become God's enemies,
or rebels against His government. They
could not be allowed to remain in Heaven.</p>

<p>The Son was appointed by the Father to
take command of the true angels, and drive
out the rebel host. Lucifer took command of the angels who
had rebelled with him, and was determined to hold his place
in Heaven.</p>

<p>Then "there was war in heaven: Michael [Christ] and
His angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought
and his angels." Revelation 12:7.</p>

<p>When Lucifer sinned and fell, his character and work were
so changed that the beautiful name he had in Heaven was
also changed. In Revelation 12:9, he is called "the dragon,"
"that old serpent," "the devil," and "Satan."</p>

<p>Of course Satan could not win in such a warfare. "He
was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with
him." Revelation 12:9.</p>

<p>In Isaiah 14:12, we read, "How art thou fallen from
Heaven, O Lucifer, Son of the Morning! how art thou cut
down to the ground."</p>

<p>Christ refers to this when He said to His disciples, "I beheld
Satan as lightning fall from Heaven." Luke 10:18.</p>

<p>When Satan knew that he had lost Heaven forever, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
heart was filled with anger and hatred for all that was good.
His history since then shows that from that time his motto
was, "Evil, be thou my good."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/illus062.jpg" width="374" height="449" alt="Lucifer with back of hand on forehead" />
<div class="caption">"How art thou fallen, O Lucifer, Son of the Morning."</div>
</div>
<p>Revenge filled his heart in which the love of God
once abode, and all his wonderful powers
were turned against God and His
work. Every artful device
of evil angels has
been used since then to
lead men to follow them
in sin and rebellion against
God.</p>

<p>It is well for man to know
the strength of the foe he has
to meet. Satan and his angels
have on earth the same
wisdom which they had in
Heaven before their fall.
To this is added six
thousand years of experience
in their awful
work.</p>

<p>In Heaven
Satan's influence
was so great that
he was able to deceive
and lead into
rebellion nearly
half the angels. His power to deceive man is very great.</p>



<p>With such power and influence at his command, we can
never overcome the devil in our own strength. When we let
go our hold upon God we go onto the enemy's ground, and
are "taken captive by him at his will." 2 Timothy 2:26.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>But Christ has twice conquered this foe,&mdash;once in the
great battle in heaven when Satan was cast out, and again
as a man on earth when He met all his temptations and
came off victorious.</p>

<p>Hence Satan is to Christ a conquered foe. If we trust
our Lord fully He will give us strength in every hour of
need, and thus we may become "more than conquerors through
Him that loved us." Romans 8:37.</p>

<p>Paul calls Satan "The prince of the power of the air."
Ephesians 2:2. He it is who causes the terrible cyclones,
the tidal waves, and other awful disasters. Only the restraining
hand of God prevents him from bringing destruction to
the world more awful than it has yet known.</p>

<p>In Hebrews 2:14, we learn that the devil has "the power
of death." This is so because sin brought death, and Satan
is the author of sin. He claims all who die as his. Only
the power of God can bring them from "the land of the enemy"
at the resurrection.</p>

<p>But some glad day sin and death and Satan will be destroyed.
Paul declared that Christ, by His death, opened the
way by which He "might <i>destroy</i> him that had the power of
death, that is, the devil." Hebrews 2:14.</p>

<p>The Lord says through the prophet Ezekiel, "I will bring
forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall <i>devour</i> thee, and
I will bring thee to <i>ashes</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thou shalt be a terror, and
<i>never shalt thou be any more</i>." Ezekiel 28:18, 19.</p>

<p>Then, with the stain of sin entirely removed, God will
have a clean universe, as free from sin as it was before
rebellion entered heaven.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory3'><span class='bgcolor'>IN</span> six days the Creator formed the earth and fitted
it up as the home of mankind. When finished
it was very beautiful with trees, flowers, and fruits.</p>

<p>Before man was created, God also made the birds, fishes,
and all the dumb animals and creeping things. The world
was then ready for its master,&mdash;man.</p>

<p>"And God said, Let us make man in Our image, after
Our likeness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So God created man in His own image."
Genesis 1:26, 27.</p>

<p>Man was the last and most perfect work of the great creation
week. He was in the "image of God." He looked like
his Creator.</p>

<p>Some, at least, of the wisdom of God was given to him.
He could talk, and think, and reason. As we study God's
Word, and learn about Him, He helps us and teaches us.
Thus we grow more like Him, and He gives us more of His
wisdom.</p>

<p>After creating man, God made for him a beautiful garden
which was to be the home of Adam and Eve. This was a
sample of what their children were to make of the rest of the
world.</p>

<p>This home was called the "Garden of Eden." It was very
beautiful, for "out of the ground made the Lord God to grow
every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food."
Genesis 2:9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed." This
shows what is the best kind of food for man to eat.
"And to every beast of the earth, and to
every fowl of the air, and to every thing
that creepeth upon the earth, wherein
there is life, I have given every green
herb for meat." Genesis 1:29, 30.
This was a perfect diet. The
Lord did not intend that
His creatures should
be killed and eaten
for food.</p>

<p>A beautiful
"river went out of
Eden to water the
garden." The tree
of life was also
there. This tree
had wonderful
power. It would preserve
life, and so long as one
should eat of it he would
never die.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
<img src="images/illus066.jpg" width="481" height="533" alt="statement not backed up by the Bible" />
<div class="caption">"Heavenly visitors taught them about God."</div>
</div>

<p>"And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the
garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." Genesis 2: 15.
Man was not to live in idleness, but must care for the beautiful
home which God had prepared for him.</p>

<p>After all was completed the Lord gave to man the earth
and all that was in it. David said, "The earth hath He given
to the children of men." Psalms 115:16.</p>

<p>Man was also to be ruler of all that was on the earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
For the Lord said, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth, and <i>subdue</i> it; and <i>have dominion</i> over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth." Genesis
1:28.</p>

<p>Even the beasts loved man and delighted
to obey him. There was no fear
in that wonderful home. All was love,
and happiness, and peace.</p>

<p>Christ and the beautiful angels from
Heaven often visited the happy
pair in Eden.</p>

<p>These heavenly visitors
taught them about God
and His love, and gave
them such instruction as
would help them to take
proper care of their
earthly home.</p>

<p>Before Satan could
reach them with his temptations,
angels were sent
from Heaven to warn them of
his fall, and of his desire to
bring ruin upon then, as he had already
done upon the angels who
sinned with him. In this the loving,
tender care of God for His creatures
was manifested.</p>

<div class="caption">Satan Entering Eden.</div>
</div>

<p>God is love. He did not wish sin to
enter the world; yet He made man free so that he could
choose wrong doing if he preferred it to God's way, after knowing
of the dreadful results of sin.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory4'><span class='bgcolor'>THE</span> love and obedience of every intelligent
being must be tested. Tests
make character. If we obey God's laws
and walk in His ways, we become in character
like God and sinless angels.</p>

<p>We must have a good character before
we are fit to enjoy the beautiful home Christ is preparing for
those who are faithful. God will give us a good character, and
help us to obey, if we ask Him.</p>

<p>If we refuse to let God help us do right, we are out of
harmony, or at war with Him and Heaven. We then come
into harmony, or union, with Satan and his angels, and when
sin is destroyed we must perish with it.</p>

<p>Sin makes people unhappy, and God hates it because He
loves everybody. Happiness can be found only in obedience,
or doing right.</p>

<p>Before sin reached Eden, Adam and Eve knew nothing of
evil. So their only test was in regard to one special tree
planted in the garden. It was called the "tree of knowledge
of good and evil."</p>

<p>God said of the fruit of this tree, "Ye shall not eat of it,
neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die." Genesis 3:3. If they
kept away from this tree they would never know evil. At
that tree was the only place where Satan could meet them to
tempt them.</p>

<p>One day the curiosity of Eve led her to come near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
forbidden tree. By so doing she placed herself where Satan
could tempt her, and he was there to meet her as he always
meets us when we go in the way of temptation.</p>

<p>Satan did not come in his own form, but in the shape of
a beautiful Serpent. Eve would have known him in his real
person, for angels had told the first pair about the rebellion
of Satan and his angels. Satan never comes to us as he
really is. He comes as a deceiver, just as he came to Eve in
the garden.</p>

<p>The serpent told Eve that the forbidden
fruit was good, and began to eat some of it.
Probably he told her
that it gave him power
to talk. Eve looked
at it and thought
about it. The more
she looked at it the
more she wanted some of it.</p>

<p>But she told the serpent
that the Lord had forbidden
them to eat of it, for if they did
they should "surely die."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/illus069.jpg" width="425" height="318" alt="Another bit of story not backed by the Bible" />
<div class="caption">Angels sent to tell the first pair about
the rebellion of Satan and his angel.</div>
</div>

<p>But the serpent said, "Ye shall
not surely die." "See, I am eating of it and it does me no
harm. In fact, I feel better all the time I am eating of this
fruit."</p>

<p>"For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then
your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing
good and evil." Genesis 3:5.</p>

<p>The devil's statement was partly true and partly a lie.
And in all his work he will mix enough truth with his lies
to deceive those who do not know him and his ways well
enough to see the difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that the fruit of that tree would make those wise
who ate of it. It would make them wise in the knowledge of
evil, and the Lord did not want them to know anything of
evil. Such knowledge brings death.</p>

<p>But Satan lied when he said,
"Ye shall not surely die," and
he knew it. He has been telling
this lie ever since. The
Lord has said, "The soul
that sinneth it shall die."</p>

<p>Eve believed the devil
instead of God. She ate
of the fruit and gave to
Adam, and he ate of it.</p>

<p>The first result of their
sin was shame. They
saw that they were naked.
Then they made themselves
aprons of fig leaves,
and hid themselves so that
none should see them. Sin
always brings shame.</p>

<p>But they could not hide from
God. He called them and asked
what they had been doing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/illus070.jpg" width="385" height="579" alt="Adam and Eve trying to avoid God" />
<div class="caption">Hiding from God.</div>
</div>

<p>Then they began to make excuses and
to blame others, just as we often do when it
is found out that we have done wrong; but
they could not deceive their Creator. He told them they
should have a life of toil and trouble, and would finally die.
Then they were driven from their beautiful garden home.</p>

<p>After that the earth was to be the battle ground between
good and evil, between Satan and the Gospel. The Garden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Eden contained so many of the beautiful things of God that
it was too sacred to become such a battle ground. Sin must
not mar it. So man was driven from it to build for
himself, as best he could, a new
home which he must keep in
order by hard work.</p>

<p>The earth was cursed
with weeds and thistles;
but this was not a
real evil to fallen
man; for while sin is
in the world even hard
work is a blessing because
it helps to keep
people out of mischief.
It has been truly said
that Satan always
finds work for idle
hands to do.</p>

<p>By disobeying God
and obeying Satan
man became the
servant of sin and
Satan. Paul says,
"Know ye not, that
to whom ye yield
yourselves servants
to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?" Romans 6:16.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>WHEN</span> one person is owned by another person,
and has to work for him, he is called a
slave, or a bond-servant, because he is in
bondage, and not free to do what would be
best for himself.</p>

<p>So it is with one who lets himself be controlled
by the evil instead of by the good. The
word devil is like the word evil, and means the same. To do
evil is to do as the devil wishes us to do. Put <i>d</i> before <i>evil</i>,
and you will see where evil comes from.</p>

<p>A slave can not get free from a cruel master. He has no
money to buy his own freedom, and no power to get away.
If he tries to escape, he is followed and caught, and brought
back again to work for his hateful owner.</p>

<p>Adam and Eve really sold themselves to Satan&mdash;the evil,
the devil&mdash;by doing as he wanted them to do. They traded
their happiness for the knowledge of wrong which he promised
them, and which he gave them.</p>

<p>Thus he became their owner, or master, instead of God
who had made them, and to whom they really belonged.</p>

<p>Now they could not get free, and as the wages, or end of
sin, is death, they must serve Satan all their lives and then
die, without any hope of another life beyond this one.</p>

<p>God and Christ and the angels all pitied man in this sad
condition, and Christ offered to leave Heaven and come to this
earth and give His life for man's life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Only in this way could He buy back, or redeem man
(meaning everybody), so that all who want to be free from the
service of Satan and sin can escape death, which is "the
wages of sin."</p>

<p>Sometimes a rich man buys
a slave from his cruel master,
so that the poor man can be
free and happy. So Jesus did
for us.</p>

<p>We get free from Satan by
thanking God for this plan to
save us, and asking Him, for
Christ's sake, to forgive our
sins and help us to live a good
life, away from our old master,
the evil.</p>

<p>This is what the word Redemption
means. It is buying
back something that has been
sold into bondage. Jesus
bought us back after we had
sold ourselves to Satan.</p>

<p>"Ye are not your own, for
ye are bought with a price,"
"the precious blood [the life]
of Christ." 1 Corinthians 6:19,
20; 1 Peter 1:18, 19.</p>

<p>This "good news," or Gospel
of Salvation, was told to
Adam and Eve as well as to
the shepherds on the plains of Bethlehem hundreds of years
afterward, so that all could have a chance to obey God by
being made free from the power of Satan.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>CAIN</span> and Abel were the first brothers who ever
lived on the earth. Cain, the elder brother,
was a farmer. Abel was a shepherd, and cared
for his father's sheep.</p>

<p>The Bible does not tell us about them when
they were boys, but when they were grown it says they both
brought offerings to the Lord. Abel brought a lamb as his
offering, but Cain brought the fruits of the ground.</p>

<p>The Lord had told them to bring a lamb for an offering,
because it would cause them to think of Christ, for He was
"the Lamb of God" who was to die for the sins of the world.</p>

<img src="images/illus076b.jpg" alt="The offerings of Cain and Abel" width="472" height="408" class="split" />
</div>
<p>Before Jesus came to die, men showed their faith in Him
by bringing a lamb for their sins. God accepted the offerings
of all who were sorry for their sins, and forgave them. This
was the Gospel in the Old Testament. Christ was the "Lamb
slain from the beginning of the world," because, before the
world began the plan was laid that He should die for man if
he sinned.</p>

<p>Abel had faith in God. His heart was filled with love because
a way had been made by which sinners could return to
God, receive pardon, and finally be taken to a new Eden home.</p>

<p>Abel brought a lamb from his flock, and offered it to God
for his sins. Looking at the lamb of his sacrifice he saw
Christ, the dying Lamb, on the mountain of Calvary. His
faith was "counted to him for righteousness," meaning that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
God called him good. His sins were forgiven. God was pleased
with the offering brought by Abel, and so He sent down fire
from heaven and burned up the
sacrifice; but not so with Cain's
fruit.</p>

<p>Then the heart of Cain was
like the heart of Satan,&mdash;filled with
hatred and rebellion against God.
He could see the beautiful Garden
of Eden which had been the home
of his parents, but he could not
enter it. An angel with a flaming
sword guarded the gateway.</p>

<div>
<img src="images/illus077a.jpg" alt="The next act was to kill his brother" width="224" height="424" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/illus077b.jpg" alt="The next act was to kill his brother" width="405" height="213" class="splitr" />
</div>

<p>In his heart
he charged God
with cruelty in
shutting them
out of the garden,
and dooming
mankind to
a life of labor
and sorrow. He
did not accept
with gratitude
the wonderful
sacrifice made
by the Son of
God to redeem
the world.</p>

<p>He preferred
to talk of what
he called the cruelty of the Creator in punishing the race.
Instead of offering in sacrifice a lamb, which only could represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the sacrifice of Christ, he brought the fruits of the
ground. He thought as sometimes people do now, that what
we have to offer is good enough, even if it is not just what
the Lord calls for.</p>

<p>In Cain's offering there was nothing to
point to the offering of Christ. There was
no blood showing that death follows sin,
and that Christ was to bear it for us. It
was in every way contrary to God's plan,
and so it showed no faith. There was
therefore no Gospel in it, and no salvation.
The Lord did not accept Cain's
offering, and there was no answering fire.</p>

<p>As Cain saw the difference, he charged
God with partiality, and then began to
hate his brother, as all wicked people hate
the good. The next act was to kill his
brother, which was the result of his hatred.</p>

<p>Then the Lord spoke to Cain and asked
him, "Where is thy brother Abel?" Cain
tried to cover up his
sin by lying about it,
as some people try to
get out of trouble now.
He said, "I know not;
Am I my brother's
keeper?"</p>

<p>But the Lord knew
all about it, for Cain
could not hide his sin
from the Lord any more than we can hide ours. The Lord
sent him forth as a wanderer in the earth, and a hateful look
marked his face as long as he lived. Faces show character.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory'><span class='bgcolor'>BEFORE</span> the flood men lived to be nearly a
thousand years old. They were much larger
and stronger than they are now. Living so long
they became very wise and very rich.</p>

<p>For many years there were those who believed
in God and obeyed Him. But in time most of the
people forgot Him and became very wicked.</p>

<p>"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in
the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his
heart was only evil continually.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the earth was filled
with violence." Genesis 6:5, 11.</p>

<p>So the Lord said He would bring a flood of waters on the
earth to drown all the wicked people.</p>

<p>But Noah and his family were faithful to God. So He
told Noah to build a great boat, called the ark. It was so
large that it would hold all his family, and some of all kinds
of animals and birds. It also had room to hold food for them
for many days.</p>

<p>The world was warned in regard to the flood, for Noah was
one hundred and twenty years building the ark. Part of this
time he preached, telling the people of the coming flood, and
part of the time he worked on the ark.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus080.jpg" width="600" height="448" alt="Ark and animals in pairs" />
<div class="caption">Entering the Ark.</div>
</div>

<p>But the people were too busy and too wicked to heed the
preaching of Noah. They only laughed at him for wasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a><br /><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
his time and money building such a great boat so far from
water deep enough to float it.</p>

<p>When the ark was finished, the Lord caused the animals
from the forest, and the birds of the air, to come to it. They
came two and two, and went to their places in perfect order.
The angels of the Lord were leading them, although none
could see them. It must have been a wonderful sight.</p>

<p>When all were in the ark, the Lord shut the heavy door.
Then the rain came down and the thunder rolled. The crust
of the earth was broken up, and the water under the surface
was thrown up in great water-spouts.</p>

<p>The water rose higher and higher. It rained forty days
and forty nights. Men and animals climbed to the tops of the
highest mountains. But finally these were all covered. Then
all the human beings, the birds, and the animals on the
whole earth were drowned.</p>

<p>But all that were in the ark rode safely on the waters.
The power of God protected the ark through all this terrible
time.</p>

<p>Then the Lord caused a wind to blow, which dried up the
water. After floating one hundred and fifty days, the ark
rested upon the top of Mount Ararat.</p>

<p>After this Noah waited forty days, and then he opened the
window in the top of the ark and sent out a raven and a dove.
But they found no place to rest, and so returned to the ark.</p>

<p>Seven days after, he sent out another dove, and in the
evening it returned with an olive leaf in its mouth. After
another seven days, he again sent out a dove, but it did not
return.</p>

<p>Finally the water was fully dried up, and God told Noah
that he and all the birds and animals could leave the ark.
They must have been very glad to be on the land once more,
for they had been in the ark a year and seventeen days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Noah was very thankful to God for saving their lives.
"And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, and took of every
clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings
on the altar." Genesis 8:20.</p>

</div>

<p>The Lord was pleased with
this offering, for it showed
that Noah was still true to
God, and had faith in Jesus
Christ, the great Sacrifice
for the sins of the world.</p>

<p>Then the Lord said that
He would not
again destroy the
earth with a flood.
And as a covenant,
or pledge in regard
to this promise,
He set the beautiful
rainbow in the
clouds.</p>

<p>As all the
wicked were destroyed
from the
earth, the Lord made a new start with the
family of faithful Noah, to raise up a people that
would obey Him and be finally redeemed, or
brought back to the first dominion.</p>

<p>Jesus said, "As the days of Noah were, so
shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the
days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah
entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and
took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of
man be." Matthew 24:37-39.</p>

</div>

<p class='dropcapstory4'><span class='bgcolor'>NOT</span> long after the flood, some of the descendants
of Noah forgot God who had saved their fathers
in the ark. They began to worship idols as the
people did before the flood.</p>

<p>Then Nimrod gathered these wicked people together
and went with them to the plain of Shinar. Nimrod
was a grandson of Ham, and a great grandson of Noah. He
was a mighty hunter, and became famous in the earth.</p>

<p>The Lord wanted the people to move in small companies
into different places all over the earth. In this way it could
be best settled and subdued, or cultivated.</p>

<p>Nimrod wanted to build large cities and keep the people
together. In this way he wished to establish a government
that would finally rule the world.</p>

<p>"The beginning of his kingdom was Babel." In this city
they decided to build a great tower that would be the wonder
of the world. They thought they would make the tower so
high that they could go to the top of it and be safe if ever
there came another flood.</p>

<p>God had promised that He would never again destroy the
world by a flood, but these people did not believe God. They
forgot that if God could bring a flood on the earth He could
also destroy any city and tower that man could build.</p>

<p>For a long time the work of building this great tower
went forward rapidly. It was finished inside into many rooms,
some of which were used as temples for idol worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<div>
<img src="images/illus084a.jpg" alt="Then the people were scattered abroad in the earth." width="338" height="197" class="split" />
<img src="images/illus084b.jpg" alt="Then the people were scattered abroad in the earth." width="503" height="426" class="split" />
</div>

<p>How long they were at work on this tower we do not
know, but it reached to a great height. The builders were
much pleased with their work, and praised the gods of silver
and gold. They believed that
these idols were giving them
success.</p>

<p>Then the Lord interfered
with their work. He would
teach the people that He was
the true and all-powerful God.
He would show to the world
that their idols
could not help
them nor give
them any real
success.</p>

<p>It is always
best to trust
and obey the
true God. He
alone can give
true happiness
and success.
Some people
now trust in
their riches.
Some trust in
their strength.
Some trust in
their education. But almost every day we hear of some rich
man who has lost his wealth, some strong man who loses his
strength by sickness, some educated man who has failed in
his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>But the man who obeys God and walks in His ways in
this world, is sure of success. He may not be rich, nor strong,
nor have great learning, but he will have true happiness and
a reward by and by greater than all the world can give.</p>

<p>Before building the tower of Babel the whole world spoke
one language, and the people could understand one another
easily. But when their work seemed most successful, the Lord
made them speak different languages. None could understand
what the others were saying.</p>

<p>Soon all was confusion. If the workmen ordered brick
sent to them, they got mortar. If they ordered stone, perhaps
they got wood. This made the workman very angry,
and their work ended in disappointment and strife.</p>

<p>Then the people were scattered abroad in the earth as God
intended they should be. The tower was then called the tower
of Babel, which means tower of confusion.</p>

<p>Many years afterward the city of Babylon was built around
this tower, and the tower was used as a temple of their god
Belus. The tower was then named the Temple of Belus.</p>

<h2>The Call of Abraham.</h2>

<img src="images/illus087d.jpg" alt="The Call of Abraham." width="124" height="57" class="split" />
</div>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>AFTER</span> the people were scattered from Babel, they
became more wicked than before. Nearly all
turned from the true God, and worshiped idols.
Abraham remained true to God; but even his
father's household were beginning to worship false gods. The
world then was about as wicked as before the flood.</p>

<p>Then God chose Abraham to represent Him in the earth.
He would call him the father of the faithful, which means
those who have faith, or who believe God. He would give
His truth a new start, as He did when He chose Noah
before the flood.</p>

<p>God would not destroy the sinners, as He did at the flood,
but would call Abraham out from among them. Then
through Abraham He would give to the world the knowledge
of the only true God.</p>

<p>But the Lord must separate Abraham from his own kindred
and friends, and teach him, and fit him to be the father
of a nation that should serve Him. Hence Abraham must
leave his home, and go where the wicked lives of his friends
and relatives would not lead him away from God.</p>

<p>And God said, "Get thee out of thy country, and from
thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that
I will show thee." Genesis 12:1.</p>

<p>Abraham obeyed at once. "And he went out, not knowing
whither he went." He loved his home, but he loved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
obey God more than he loved his home or friends. He did
not even know where he was going. He simply trusted God.</p>

<p>The Lord led him to the land of Canaan, or Palestine.
Lot, who was his nephew, was the only one of his relatives
who went with him.</p>

<p>Abraham was very rich. He had vast flocks and herds
and a large number of servants to care for them. Lot had
also large flocks and many servants.</p>

<p>When Abraham finally pitched his tents in Canaan, he
was distressed to find the country filled with idolatry. Idols
were worshiped in the temples and groves, and human beings
were sacrificed upon the hills.</p>

<p>But the Lord appeared to him in the night and said,
"Unto thy seed will I give this land," and, "I will multiply
thy seed as the stars of heaven."</p>

<p>This gave him hope and courage, "And there builded he
an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him." Genesis
12:7. He did the same as Abel and Noah. He offered a
lamb. This shows that he believed in Jesus who was to die
for the sins of the world.</p>

<p>The Lord prospered Abraham in Canaan, and his wealth,
his flocks and herds, increased wonderfully. By the example
of his life the Canaanites learned of the true God.</p>
<div>
<img src="images/illus089a.jpg" alt="The Departure of Hagar." width="402" height="191" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/illus089b.jpg" alt="The Departure of Hagar." width="494" height="331" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/illus089c.jpg" alt="The Departure of Hagar." width="270" height="145" class="splitr" />
</div>

<p>Wherever he pitched his tent he built an altar to the
true God, and morning and evening called his large family
together to sacrifice and prayer.</p>

<p>Thus the Canaanites learned of the God of Abraham.
They saw that the Lord was with him. But idol worship had
so strong a hold upon them that few turned to the true God.</p>

<p>By and by there came a great drought in Canaan. The
rain ceased to fall, the streams were dried, and the grass withered.
It seemed that his whole encampment must perish.</p>

<p>Then Abraham journeyed to Egypt where he remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
until the rains again filled the streams and caused the grass
to grow in Canaan.</p>

<p>By this visit to Egypt the people there learned of the true
God. Thus, in His own way the
knowledge of a promised Saviour
was taken by Abraham to the
great countries of Canaan and
Egypt.</p>

<p>It was God's plan that
through Abraham and his
descendants the
whole world
should learn of
the "good news"
of salvation from
sin and death,
through Christ
who was to suffer
for men, and
thus buy them
back to God and
happiness.</p>

<p>But Abraham
had no
children, and Sarah, his wife, did not
believe that God would give her a son.
So she got Abraham to marry her
Egyptian maid, Hagar. But the Lord
said that His promise was not to be
fulfilled through Ishmael, the son of
this woman, but through a son whom He would give Sarah.
So after Isaac was born, Hagar and Ishmael were sent away;
for the Lord had said, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called."</p>

<p class='dropcapstory2'><span class='bgcolor'>ABRAHAM</span> returned from Egypt "very rich in cattle,
in silver, and in gold." Lot was still with
him, and their flocks and herds became so great
that they could not find pasture for them all together.</p>

<p>So Abraham said to Lot, "Is not the whole land before
thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou wilt
take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart
to the right hand, then I will go to the left."</p>

<p>Abraham was the elder, and the choice should have been
his. But he was not selfish, and so gave the choice to the
younger man, his nephew.</p>

<p>Lot selfishly chose the plain of Jordan. This was the
most beautiful and productive portion of all the land of Canaan.
And he "pitched his tent toward Sodom."</p>

<p>But Lot did not stop to consider that Sodom and the other
cities of the plain were very wicked. He thought only of his
own interests, and was soon living in the city of Sodom itself.
His daughters married wicked men of Sodom, and so forgot
God. Lot could now see the evil of choosing his home among
wicked people.</p>

<p>At last Sodom and some of the other cities near it became
so wicked that God would not suffer them to remain. He
must destroy them from off the earth. But first the Lord
would tell Abraham what He was about to do.</p>

<p>One day when it was very warm, Abraham sat in the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of his tent. Soon he saw three strangers coming toward him.
He ran to them and asked them to come and sit under a tree
and rest while he prepared some food for them to eat.</p>

<p>After they had eaten, two of the men
went toward Sodom, but the third, who
was the Lord, or Christ, remained to
tell Abraham that He was about to
destroy Sodom.</p>

<p>Then Abraham began to plead for
Sodom. He made
many requests of
the Lord, and
finally gained the
promise that if
ten righteous
people could be
found in Sodom
the city would be
saved.</p>

<p>In his child-like
faith Abraham
felt safe
when this promise
was made. In
the household of
Lot alone he thought there must be at least ten who were true
to God. But the evil surroundings of Sodom had corrupted
even the family of Lot.</p>
<div>
<img src="images/illus092a.jpg" alt="The three angels" width="273" height="77" class="split" />

</div>

<p>The two angels who left Abraham came to Lot and told
him to take his sons and daughters, and flee from the city.
But these young persons, who were married to the people of
Sodom, would not heed the warning.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the angels told Lot to take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wife and the two daughters who were with him, and hasten
out of the city.</p>

<p>But Lot lingered, for he was sorry to know that some of
his children, his friends, the beautiful city, and all his wealth
must be destroyed. So the angels took hold of them and
hastened them out of Sodom.</p>

<p>Then the angel said to them, "Escape for thy life; look
not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to
the mountain, lest thou be consumed." And then the angel
adds, "For I can not do anything till thou be come thither."</p>

<p>The angel had said, "Look not behind thee." But the treasure
of Lot's wife was in Sodom. She did not heed the warning
of the angel. She loved her beautiful home and the riches of
Sodom more than she loved God. She proved unworthy of the
deliverance that the angels of God had brought to them, and
she turned and looked back to see if God really meant what
he said. That very moment she became a pillar of salt, dead
and white like a marble statue.</p>

<p>When Lot and his daughters were far away, the Lord
rained a horrible tempest of fire and brimstone upon the cities
of the plain, and they were utterly destroyed. The very ground
where they stood is now covered by the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>Thus God showed His hatred of their awful wickedness.
They loved sin, and were not thankful that God had paid the
great price of the life of His only Son in order to save them
from doing wrong, if they would only ask Him for help to do
right. Holding on to sin they perished with it, as many will
perish in the last great "lake of fire" "prepared for the devil
and his angels." That fire is not being prepared for man;
heaven is being fitted up for him. Oh that all would accept it!</p>

<p>Jesus said, "In my Father's house are many mansions;
I go to prepare a place for you." Which place are we preparing
ourselves for? We are to make the choice.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>GOD</span> had promised Abraham that he should
be the father of a great nation, and that
the land of Canaan should be their home.
This was not to come through Ishmael, but through
another son.</p>

<p>God had also promised that "in thy seed shall
all nations of the earth be blessed." Genesis 22:18.
Paul says, in Galatians 3:16, that the "seed" here
mentioned is Christ; so Genesis 22:18 is a promise that Christ
shall come through the family of Abraham. In Christ all
nations of the earth are blessed, although not all of them
accept the blessing.</p>

<p>Abraham was called "The friend of God," because he loved
and served the Lord so faithfully.</p>

<p>He had a son named Isaac, whom he loved very much.
God had told Abraham that Isaac should be his heir, or have
all that was Abraham's when he died. All the blessings promised
to Abraham were to come to his son Isaac.</p>

<p>But a great trial was to come to Abraham to test his faith
in God. The Lord said to him, "Take now thy son, thine
only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land
of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one
of the mountains which I will tell thee of." Genesis 22:2.</p>

<p>What a terrible test this was! How could God's promise
be fulfilled if Isaac should die? But Abraham did not distrust
God nor question His command. He believed that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Isaac should die God would "raise him up, even from the
dead." Hebrews 11:19.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Abraham took Isaac and two of
his servants and prepared for the long
journey. They cut the wood and bound
it to the back of his beast, and started
for the place of sacrifice.</p>

<p>None but Abraham knew of the
awful command of
God. His heart was
very sad as they
journeyed three days
in silence.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 442px;">
<img src="images/illus095.jpg" width="442" height="607" alt="Ascent of Mount Moriah." />
</div>

<p>On the third day
they came in sight
of the mountain God
had appointed as the
place of sacrifice.</p>

<p>"And Abraham
said unto his young
men, Abide ye here
with the ass; and I
and the lad will go
yonder and worship.</p>

<p>"And Abraham took the wood of
the burnt offering, and laid it upon
Isaac his son; and he took the fire in
his hand, and a knife; and they went
both of them together." Genesis 22:5, 6.</p>

<p>As the two walked on in silence, Isaac finally asked, "My
father," "behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb
for a burnt offering?"</p>

<p>This was the first time this question had been asked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the journey. What pain it must have brought to the heart
of the loving father! He could not tell him yet, so he said,
"God will prepare himself a lamb for a burnt offering."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;">
<img src="images/illus096.jpg" width="487" height="574" alt="Abraham not sacrificing Isaac" />
<div class="caption">"Lay not thine hands upon the lad."</div>
</div>

<p>At last they came to the appointed place. They
built an altar and placed upon it the wood. Abraham
must now tell his son the command
that God had given. He could keep
it no longer.</p>

<p>Isaac heard the message of his
fate in sorrow, but he did not resist.
Abraham was a hundred
and twenty years
old, and weak from
grief. Isaac was twenty
years old, and strong
and vigorous. He could
have escaped if he had
desired to do so,
but he, too, had
faith in God, and
was obedient to
his parents.</p>

<p>Isaac let his
aged father bind
him down to the
wood upon the
altar, just as Jesus
was to let Himself be nailed to a cross of wood. The last
good-bye had been said, and the last tender words spoken.
Then Abraham raised the knife to slay his son.</p>

<p>But before the stroke could fall, an angel calls to him
from Heaven, "Abraham, Abraham!" And the patriarch answers,
"Here am I."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the angel said, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad,
neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that thou
fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only
son from me." Genesis 22:12.</p>

<p>What a joyful command! How
easy it was to obey it! Then Abraham
saw a ram caught in the
bushes. This he took and offered
upon the altar in the place of
his son. Then they journeyed
back to their
home with joyful
hearts. The
Lord blessed
Abraham still
more because he
had obeyed Him.</p>

<img src="images/illus097.jpg" width="498" height="557" alt="The Lord Directs Abraham's Servant
In Selecting a Wife for Isaac. Genesis 24." />
</div>

<p>Abraham was
willing that Isaac
should die, believing
it to be
best, just as God
was willing that
Jesus should die
for us, knowing
it to be best.</p>

<p>Isaac was willing to lay down his own life, just as Jesus
was willing to lay down His life for us.</p>

<p>Abraham was spared the awful sorrow of seeing his son die.
Another victim was found. But no one could take the place
of Jesus. His Father and all the angels in Heaven had to see
His dreadful death; and it was all for us.</p>

</div>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>ISAAC</span> had two sons, named Jacob and Esau.
Esau was a little older than Jacob, and was a
hunter of wild animals. Jacob was a shepherd, and cared
for his father's sheep.</p>

<p>Esau, the daring hunter, was very dear to his father; but
Rebekah loved Jacob most because he was so kind and careful.</p>

<p>God had said to Rebekah that "the elder shall serve the
younger." So she knew that the Lord would especially bless
Jacob, and finally give him the birthright, which meant that
he was to have a double portion of his father's wealth, and
also become the head of the family when his father died.</p>

<p>The birthright usually went to the eldest son, but the birthright
in the family of Isaac must go to the son who would
obey God. He was to be the father of God's people,&mdash;the children
of Israel.</p>

<p>Jacob loved God, and was willing to obey Him. He greatly
desired the blessing which the birthright would bring to him.
But Esau did not love God nor care to serve Him. He would
rather live the wild, free life of a hunter, and do as he chose,
than have the birthright.</p>

<p>Jacob did not trust God as he should, for he feared that
Esau would have the birthright because he was the eldest son
of Isaac. So he studied all the time to find some plan to get
it away from Esau.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/illus100.jpg" width="371" height="500" alt="Angels ascending and descending" />
<div class="caption">Jacob's Dream.</div>
</div>

<p>One day Esau had been in the fields hunting, but had found
nothing. On the way home he became very hungry. Coming
to the tent of his brother he found him preparing his dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a><br /><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of pottage. "And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me I pray thee,
with that same red pottage; for I am faint."</p>

<p>Jacob forgot that he ought to be kind to his brother. He
only thought that this was the chance he had been looking
for. "And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright."</p>

<p>"And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die; and
what profit shall this birthright do to me?" So he sold his
birthright to his brother for a good dinner.</p>

<p>You see Jacob took a mean advantage of his brother when
he was faint and hungry. This made it easier for him afterward
to do another great wrong, and deceive his father. One
wrong act always makes it easier to do another.</p>

<p>When Isaac was very old he became blind. He was still
determined to give the birthright to Esau. So one day he
told him to go into the field and kill a deer and make some
savory meat, and then he would bless him.</p>

<p>But Rebekah heard it, and she was afraid the Lord would
let Esau have the birthright. She thought she must do something
to help the Lord keep His promise that Jacob should
be head of the family.</p>

<p>So she told Jacob to kill two young goats, and she made
savory meat, such as Esau made from venison. Then she
dressed Jacob in Esau's clothes, and sent him in to deceive his
blind father.</p>

<p>This was very wicked, for Jacob told lies to his father to
make him think that he was Esau. So through falsehood
Jacob got the blessing which made him head of the family.</p>

<p>When Esau returned and learned what Jacob had done, he
was very angry. Fearing that his brother would kill him,
Jacob fled from his father's house, and went to Mesopotamia,
where his mother's family lived.</p>

<p>He felt very sorrowful on his journey. He was afraid that
his sin was too great to be forgiven. But one night he confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
it all to God, and then laid his head on a stone for a
pillow, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>In the night the Lord gave him a beautiful
dream. In it he saw a ladder which reached
from earth to heaven. On this ladder there
were angels ascending and descending.</p>

<p>At the top of the ladder Jacob saw his
Saviour, who told him that He was the God of
Abraham and Isaac, and that He would be his
God, and make him the father of a great nation.
This was because Jacob was sorry for his sins.
The Lord promised to go with him on
his journey, and finally
bring him back
again, and that his
children should have
the land of Canaan
for their home.</p>

<p>From this place
Jacob journeyed until
he came to the
home of Laban,
his mother's
brother. Here he
worked hard twenty
years.</p>

<p>One night the Lord came to him in a dream, and said,
"Arise, get thee out of this land, and return unto the land
of thy kindred." Then Jacob prepared immediately to return
to Canaan.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>JACOB</span> had become very rich in sheep
and cattle, and had many servants to
care for them. His journey back to Canaan
was slow. He was very sad because of his
sin in deceiving his father.</p>

<p>As he neared his old home he learned that Esau
was coming against him with four hundred armed
soldiers. Jacob had no soldiers, and was much afraid.</p>

<p>Then Jacob divided his band into two companies, thinking
that at least one might escape. He then sent servants with
splendid presents to Esau, hoping thus to touch the heart of
his brother.</p>

<p>Jacob had now done all that he could do. Then he went
by himself to spend the night in prayer. He knew that
God could touch the heart of his brother, and this was his
only hope.</p>

<p>While praying he suddenly felt a hand laid upon him.
He thought it was an enemy seeking his life. He put forth
all his strength to escape, but could not. Jacob struggled and
wrestled until near morning.</p>

<p>Then the stranger touched him on the hollow of his thigh,
and his thigh was put out of joint. Then Jacob knew that
he had been struggling with an angel, and not with a man.
It was the Lord, his Saviour.</p>

<p>Jacob ceased to struggle, and clung to the Angel. He knew
he must have divine help or perish. Unless God should work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a><br /><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
for him, his brother Esau would overcome and destroy him.</p>

<div class="caption">Jacob and the Angel.</div>
</div>
<p>But Jacob's faith must be fully tested. The Angel said,
"Let me go, for the day breaketh." With the realizing sense
of his sins and of his deep need, he clung to his Lord the
closer, and cried, "I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me."</p>

<p>And "he had power over
the Angel, and prevailed; he
wept and made supplication
unto Him; he found Him in
Bethel." And the Angel said
unto him, "What is thy name?
And he said, Jacob. And He
said, Thy name shall be called
no more Jacob, but Israel [A
prince of God]; for as a prince
hast thou power with
God and with men,
and hast prevailed."</p>

<p>If we come to God
as Jacob did, with confession,
with tears,
and a perseverance
that will not be denied,
we can prevail
with Him also.</p>

<p>The Lord sent an
angel to soften the heart of Esau. At sight of Jacob "Esau
ran to meet him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and
they wept."</p>

<p>Jacob journeyed to the Jordan, which he crossed, and "came
in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of
Canaan." Here he erected an altar which he named "El-elohe-Israel,"
which means, "God, the God of Israel."</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>JACOB</span> had twelve sons. The ten elder sons were
shepherds. They often went far from home to
find grass and water for their father's flocks.
Joseph and Benjamin, the two younger sons,
remained at home with their father.</p>

<p>The elder sons were quarrelsome, and gave their
father much trouble. But Joseph was gentle, kind,
and truthful. And Jacob "loved Joseph more than all his
children." To show his love, Jacob made him a beautiful
coat of many colors. These things made his brothers jealous,
and they hated him.</p>

<p>But the Lord was pleased with Joseph because he loved to
do right and obey his father. God had a great work for Joseph
to do. So He gave him two dreams which came true many
years afterward.</p>

<p>In his first dream Joseph saw himself and his eleven brothers
in the field binding grain into bundles, or sheaves. And
his bundle arose and stood upright, and his brothers' bundles
bowed down to his bundle.</p>

<p>Probably Joseph did not know what his dream meant. Had
he known, he would not have told it to his brothers. When
he did tell it to them they hated him more than ever, and
said, "Shalt thou indeed rule over us?"</p>

<p>Some time after this Joseph dreamed another dream. In
this dream he saw the sun, moon, and eleven stars. And they
all bowed down to him. He told this dream to his father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to his brethren. And his father said to him, "Shall I and
thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves
to thee to the earth?" But years after, when the famine
came, the father, brothers, and their
families had to depend on Joseph for
even the food which they ate.</p>

<p>One day Jacob sent Joseph to
find his brethren, for he wanted to
know if
they were
well. They
were many
miles away
caring for
the sheep.</p>

<p>When
they saw
Joseph coming,
these wicked brothers
said one to another, "Behold,
this dreamer cometh. Let us
slay him, and cast him into
some pit, and we will say, Some
evil beast hath devoured him;
and we shall see what will become
of his dreams."</p>


<p>But Reuben would not consent
to have Joseph killed, so
they took off his beautiful coat,
and cast him alive into a pit.
Soon a company of Ishmaelites came along on their way to
Egypt. Then the brothers drew him out of the pit and sold
him to be a slave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>After Joseph was gone, the brothers began to think of their
father, and what they should tell him. Then to hide their
sin they did another wicked thing. They killed a young goat
and put its blood all over Joseph's coat, so it would look as
though some wild beast had slain him.</p>

<p>Some of the brothers then took the
coat to their father, and told him they
had found it. They said they had brought
it to him to see if it was Joseph's coat.</p>

<p>And Jacob said, "It is Joseph's coat;
some evil beast hath devoured him."
And Jacob rent
his clothes and
mourned for his
son many days.
The wicked
brothers deceived
their
father then, but
many years
afterward the
truth came out,
and they had to
confess their
sin.</p>

</div>

<p>Joseph was
sold to a rich man in Egypt, by the name of Potiphar. The
Lord blessed Joseph, and Potiphar saw that whatever he did
prospered. So he made him steward of all that he had.</p>

<p>But God had a higher place for Joseph, and he must reach
it through affliction. In all his troubles it was the Lord who
was giving Joseph just the training he needed to fit him for
the great work before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Through a wicked and false charge of Potiphar's wife, Joseph
was cast into prison. But by his honesty he gained the confidence
of the keeper of the prison, and was given charge of
the prisoners.</p>

<p>One morning he met the chief butler and the chief baker
of the king. They had been cast into prison for some offense,
and were looking very sad. He kindly asked the cause, and
each said that he had dreamed a strange dream, and could
not tell what it meant.</p>

<p>Joseph then said, "Do not interpretations belong to God?
tell me them, I pray thee." Then they told their dreams,
and the Lord told Joseph their meaning. In three days the
butler was to go back to his place with the king, but the
baker would be put to death.</p>

<p>Then Joseph told the story of his wrong treatment to the
butler, and asked him to tell the king, and try to get him
out of prison. But the butler was like many other people who
soon forget those who were their friends in trouble. When he
got out of prison he forgot all about Joseph and his request.</p>

<p>But God was working all the time in His own way. The
king had two dreams in one night, which seemed to mean the
same thing. He wanted to understand them, so he called in
the wise men of his kingdom, but they could not tell what
the dreams meant.</p>

<p>Now get your Bible and read the forty-first and forty-second
chapters of the book of Genesis, and see what these dreams
were, and how the Lord got Joseph out of prison and made
him ruler of Egypt.</p>

<p>When the dreadful famine came, he had corn saved up to
keep the Egyptians from starving. Thus the Lord often uses
good people to provide for the needs of those who are evil.</p>

<p>But God had another reason for delivering Joseph from
prison. What do you think it was?</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>WHEN</span> food began to be scarce with Jacob's family,
he sent his ten sons to Egypt to buy corn.
Joseph knew his brethren when he saw them,
but they did not know him. He did not look
like the boy whom they had sold.</p>

<p>As they bowed before him, the ruler of Egypt, he remembered
his dreams of many years before. He saw them fulfilled
completely. As the sheaves had bowed to his sheaf, so
his brethren were now bowing to him.</p>

<p>His heart went out in love for them, but before he should
tell them who he was, he wanted to know if they were still
wicked, or if their hearts had been changed since he had been
separated from them.</p>

<p>Joseph accused them of being spies. But they denied the
charge, and said that they were true men, and a family of
twelve brethren. Ten were in Egypt, the youngest was with
their father, and one was dead. They had never heard of
Joseph since they had sold him, and supposed he was dead.</p>

<p>But Joseph still accused them of being spies, and shut them
all up in prison for three days. These days in prison were
days of sorrow. They felt that they were being punished for
their cruel treatment of Joseph.</p>

<p>Finally Joseph called them from prison. He told them
that all but one could return to their father. He would keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Simeon in prison until they should come back to Egypt, but
they must bring their youngest brother when they came, or
Joseph would not even see them.</p>

<p>Joseph chose Simeon to remain because he had been the
chief actor in their cruelty to him in the past. They returned
to their home with heavy hearts.</p>

<p>When the food brought from Egypt was nearly gone, Jacob
said to his sons, "Go again, buy us a little food." But they
dared not go unless Benjamin should go with them. To this
the father at last consented, and they again went to Egypt,
taking with them presents for the great governor.</p>

<p>As they started, the sorrowful father raised his hands to
heaven and prayed, "God Almighty give you mercy before the
man, that he may send away your elder brother, and Benjamin.
If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."</p>

<p>When they reached Egypt, their brother Simeon was released,
and all were brought to dine at the house of the governor.
According to the customs of Egypt, Joseph must eat
at a table by himself, and the eleven brothers at a table by
themselves. They had been jealous of Joseph in his home,
and he wanted to know if they had become better men. So
he sent five times as much food to Benjamin. They showed
no jealousy now.</p>

<p>But Joseph desired to test them once more. So when the
sacks were filled with corn he had his silver drinking cup put
secretly into Benjamin's sack.</p>

<p>The eleven brothers departed joyfully, and felt that they
had escaped all the perils which they feared. But they had
hardly left the city when they were overtaken by the governor's
steward.</p>

<p>He said to them, "Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for
good?" He then accused them of stealing the cup. They all
denied taking it, and felt so sure that they said if it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
found with one of them he should die, and all the rest would
become servants of the governor.</p>

<p>But the steward would not agree to this. He said, "He
with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
blameless." So all the sacks
were opened, and the cup
was found in Benjamin's
sack.</p>

<p>What will the brothers
do now? If still selfish, they
will leave their brother to
his fate, and go back home.
But no, they were changed
men. They would now face
any peril to save their
brother. They rent
their clothes to show
their grief, and all
went back with him
to the city, and met
the governor.</p>

<p>Then Judah offered
to become a slave
in the place of Benjamin.
This test was
enough. Joseph now
<i>knew</i> that his brothers
were changed.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>AFTER</span> the death of Joseph "there arose up a new
king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph." This
king did not wish to remember the good that
Joseph had done.</p>

<p>The children of Israel had increased in numbers; "and the
land was filled with them." The Egyptians feared that if there
was a war the Israelites would join their enemies and fight
against them.</p>

<p>So the king made them slaves, and set taskmasters over
them to make them work. "And they made their lives bitter
with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner
of service in the field."</p>

<p>They thought that by their cruelty and the hard work in
the fields, they would stop the Israelites from increasing in
the land. "But the more they afflicted them, the more they
multiplied and grew."</p>

<p>Then the cruel king commanded that all the boys should
be killed at their birth. But even this plan did not succeed.
The Israelites still increased in the land.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Moses was born. For three months
he was carefully hidden at home and cared for by his mother.
But she dared not keep him there any longer. So she made
an ark of bulrushes, and laying the babe in it, hid it among
the flags by the river.</p>

<p>His sister Miriam anxiously watched the little ark while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
mother prayed earnestly that her child might not be destroyed.
God heard the mother's prayer, for the babe in the little ark
was to be used by the Lord to deliver Israel from bondage.</p>

<p>One day the daughter of the king came to the river to
bathe. She saw the ark, and sent one of her maids to bring
it. When she opened it and saw the beautiful child, she knew
why it was there, and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
And the child wept, and Pharaoh's daughter pitied it.</p>

<p>Then Miriam came near and said to Pharaoh's daughter,
"Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women,
that she may nurse the child for thee? And Pharaoh's daughter
said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's
mother.</p>

<p>"And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child
away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages."</p>

<p>How glad the mother was to again have the care of her
own child. He was now safe, for he was the adopted son of
Pharaoh's daughter. And better still, he was in the home of
his own parents.</p>

<p>The mother had the care of her boy until he was about
twelve years old. During these years she taught him carefully
about the true God. These lessons he never forgot. They
kept him pure and free from the wickedness and idolatry which
surrounded him in after years.</p>

<p>From his humble home he was taken to the royal palace,
and became the son of Pharaoh's daughter. "And she called
his name Moses," which means, <i>drawn out</i>. For, she said, "I
drew him out of the water." In his royal home he was trained
in all the learning of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>This training fitted him for the highest position in all
Egypt. He was the leader in Pharaoh's army, and became a
great general. Pharaoh determined that when he died, his
daughter's adopted son should be king. But all the plans of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
man were "overruled by God for the training and education of
the future leader of His people." Moses was not to shine as
king of Egypt.</p>

<p>One day, when Moses was forty years old, he saw an Egyptian
smiting an Israelite. He thought the time had come for
him to help his people, so he slew the Egyptian
and buried him.</p>

<p>Here Moses made a mistake. He took into
his own hands the work which God had promised
to do. He supposed his people were to be
delivered by warfare, and that he, a skillful
general, was to be the leader of the Hebrew
armies.</p>

<p>But God had a
different plan. By
His own hand He
would bring His
people out of bondage.
In the delivering
of Israel, He
would teach the
Egyptians the
knowledge of the
true God by such
wonders and
plagues as they
could never forget.</p>

<div class="caption">Pharaoh's Daughter finds Moses in the Ark of Bulrushes.</div>
</div>

<p>When King Pharaoh learned that Moses had killed the
Egyptian, he commanded that he should be slain. But Moses
fled toward Arabia, and the Lord led him to Jethro the prince
of Midian, whose flocks he cared for during the forty years
in which God was preparing him to lead the Israelites out of
bondage.</p>

</div>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>ONE</span> day as Moses was leading Jethro's flocks
near Mount Horeb, he saw a strange sight. A
bush was on fire, but it did not burn up. So
he went to see what it should mean.</p>

<p>As he came near, a voice from the bush said
to him, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for
the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." Then Moses
knew that it was the Lord who was talking to him from the
bush.</p>

<p>The Lord told Moses that the time had come for the Israelites
to go free from their bondage in Egypt. He told Moses
to start for Egypt, and that his brother Aaron would meet
him on the way and go with him.</p>

<p>They were then to go to Pharaoh and tell him that the
God of Israel had sent them to him, and that he must let His
people go. And he gave Moses wonderful signs to show to
Pharaoh, so that he would know that God had sent them.</p>

<p>When Moses and Aaron came before Pharaoh and told him
what the Lord had said, he answered, "Who is the Lord that
I should let Israel go?" The Hebrew slaves were very valuable
to the Egyptians, and they wanted to keep them, and make
them do their hard work.</p>

<p>Pharaoh asked them to show a miracle to prove that their
God had sent them. Then they performed one of the wonders
that the Lord had given to Moses. Aaron cast down his rod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh called in his sorcerers,
who were wicked men claiming to have power to do wonderful
things. He showed them what Aaron had done with his rod,
and asked them if they could turn their rods into serpents.</p>

<p>Then the sorcerers cast down their rods, and they appeared
to become serpents also. But while they were looking at them,
Aaron's serpent swallowed the serpents of the sorcerers.</p>

<p>But the work of the sorcerers was only a deception of their
master, the devil. God only could really give life to the staff
of Aaron. Neither the devil nor his servants can give life to
anything. But the sorcerers had deceived the people and made
their work look like God's work.</p>

<p>By thus deceiving Pharaoh they destroyed the effect of God's
miracle, and so the king's heart was hardened against letting
Israel go. Satan is ever counterfeiting, or imitating, the work
of God. He often makes his lies appear like God's truth. In
this way he leads many away from God.</p>

<p>Then God sent ten terrible plagues upon the land of Egypt.
Each one was more awful than the one before it. They were
sent to teach the Egyptians that the God of Israel was the
only true God, and to punish them for refusing to obey Him.</p>

<p><i>The First Plague.</i>&mdash;The River Nile, which they worshiped,
was turned to blood.</p>

<p><i>Second Plague.</i>&mdash;An army of frogs, which the Egyptians
considered sacred, came up from the river. They went into
all the houses, and even into the ovens and the troughs where
they made their bread.</p>

<p><i>Third Plague.</i>&mdash;The very dust of Egypt became lice on
both man and beast.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Plague.</i>&mdash;Swarms of flies came up until "the land
was corrupted" because of them.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Plague.</i>&mdash;A "grievous murrain" came upon the cattle,
so that a great many of them died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sixth Plague.</i>&mdash;Moses sprinkled dust into the air, and it
became boils on man and beast.</p>

<p><i>Seventh Plague.</i>&mdash;An awful hail, mingled with fire, smote
the land, and killed all men and beasts that were not under
shelter.</p>

<p><i>Eighth Plague.</i>&mdash;Clouds of locusts came up and ate every
green thing.</p>

<p><i>Ninth Plague.</i>&mdash;"Darkness which might be felt" covered
the land for three days. It was so dark that the people did
not dare to go out of their houses.</p>

<p>Through nine plagues Pharaoh's heart had remained hard
and rebellious against God. Egypt was a ruined country because
of this. Now the Lord told Moses that He would send
one more plague, more terrible than all the others, and then
they would be glad to let His people go.</p>

<p>But before it came, the Hebrews were to "borrow" from the
Egyptians "jewels of silver and jewels of gold." For many
years they had toiled without wages. What they received at
this time was only a partial payment for their long years of
service. This silver and gold would be needed when they should
build the tabernacle in the wilderness.</p>

<p><i>Tenth Plague.</i>&mdash;At midnight the angel of the Lord was to
pass through Egypt and slay the first-born in every house,
and the first-born of beasts.</p>

<p>None of the other plagues had come near to the land of
Goshen where the children of Israel dwelt. But now they had
a part to act or they would suffer with the Egyptians when
the destroying angel should pass through the land.</p>

<p>In order to escape, the Israelites must separate from the
Egyptians, and come into their own houses. They were to
kill a lamb, and, with a bunch of hyssop, strike some of its
blood upon the door-posts of their houses. Wherever this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
done the destroying angel would "pass over" the house, and
all within it were safe.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 505px;">
<img src="images/illus122.jpg" width="505" height="414" alt="Pharaoh finds his son" />
<div class="caption">Death of the First-born.</div>
</div>
<p>They were also to roast the lamb whole, and eat it at midnight,
while the destroying angel was doing his awful work
among the Egyptians. They were to eat it standing, their
shoes on their feet, their staff in hand, ready for flight.</p>

<p>This most solemn ceremony was
called the "passover," because the destroying
angel passed over the houses
of those who had faith in
God's commands and had
put the blood
upon the door-posts
of their
houses. The children
of Israel
were commanded
to keep the passover
each year
as a memorial
of their preservation
in
Egypt.</p>

<p>The passover
was also a type of Christ, the Lamb of God. As the
blood of the passover lamb upon the door-posts saved those
in the house from death, so all will be saved now who confess
their sins, believing that the blood of Jesus was shed to
save sinners just as surely as the blood of the passover lamb
saved those who trusted in it.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>"AND</span> it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord
smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt;
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there was a great cry in Egypt;
for there was not a house where there was not one dead."</p>

<p>And Pharaoh "called for Moses and Aaron by night, and
said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people."
And he hurried them out of the land of Egypt with their
flocks and herds and all they possessed.</p>

<p>When Jacob went into Egypt his whole company numbered
only seventy. When Israel left Egypt there were six
hundred thousand men, beside women and children. The
whole number must have been nearly three millions.</p>

<p>The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day
and a pillar of fire by night. And the children of Israel went
forward and camped by the Red Sea.</p>

<p>After Israel had left Egypt, Pharaoh became angry because
he had let them go. So he took a very large army and pursued
after them, and overtook them as they were camped by
the Red Sea.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no way of escape for the Israelites. They
were hedged in between the mountain and the Red Sea, and
behind was the army of Pharaoh. But the Lord had brought
them there to test their faith, and show once more how He
would deliver them from their enemies.</p>

<img src="images/illus124.jpg" width="500" height="363" alt="crossing the sea" />
<div class="caption">The Egyptians Overthrown In the Red Sea.</div>
</div>

<p>Moses was commanded to stretch forth his rod, and as he
did so the sea parted and left a dry road through which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a><br /><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Israelites passed over and were safe. And so blind and foolish
was Pharaoh that he and his army followed after. When
Israel was safe on the other side, Moses again stretched forth
his rod, and the sea came back and drowned Pharaoh and all
his army.</p>

<p>The Lord cared for his people wonderfully on their journey.
At Marah the water was bitter, and they could not
drink it. The Lord showed Moses a tree, and told him to
cast it into the water; and when he did so it was made sweet
and good.</p>

<p>By and by the food which they had brought from Egypt
began to fail. The Lord wanted them to learn to trust Him,
and so He was willing they should have difficulties to test
them. But they did not trust the Lord. They began to complain
and find fault with Moses. God had promised to care
for them, and if they had only believed Him they would have
learned precious lessons and received great blessings.</p>

<p>Then the Lord said to Moses, "I will rain bread from
Heaven for you." In the morning they found it on the ground,
and called it Manna. Each one gathered just enough to last
through the day. This manna would keep fresh and sweet
only one day. So they all had to depend on the Lord every
day for the food they ate.</p>

<p>In Egypt the people had forgotten the Sabbath. Now the
Lord would have them remember it. So on the seventh day
no manna was given. But on the sixth day the people gathered
enough for two days.</p>

<p>And the Lord kept it sweet for them over the Sabbath.
This was a Sabbath lesson for them every week. The Sabbath
was made for man, and given to him at creation as a
memorial of God's great work of making the world in six
days. But Israel had forgotten. God wants His Sabbath kept
holy now as well as in the time of Israel in the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>When they came to Rephidim there was no water, and the
people complained again to Moses. And the Lord told Moses
to go to Mount Horeb and smite the rock with his staff.
When he did so, water burst from the rock, enough for the
whole camp. It was Moses who smote the rock, but the Lord
made the waters to flow.</p>

<p>Whenever the camp was pitched after this they found good
water flowing from the rock for them. This rock was to make
them and us think of Christ, and the water flowing from it
represents the living water of the Word of God which He gives
to all who want it.</p>

<p>Soon a new danger arose. The Amalekites came out to
attack them. Joshua led the armies of Israel against them.
While the battle was going on, Moses stood on a hill and
raised his hands to God and prayed for the success of Israel.
When he became weary and lowered his hands, the Amalekites
were successful. Then Aaron and Hur held up the hands of
Moses until the sun went down, and Israel gained the victory.</p>

<p>This was to teach Israel that the victory came from God,
and that he would hear and answer prayer. It also taught
them that they should help their leader, Moses, in the great
work he had to do.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>FROM</span> Rephidim Israel journeyed to
Mount Sinai. Here God would give
His law to the people, and here they were
to build the tabernacle for His holy service.</p>

<p>Before this time these people had no
books to read. God's Word and His law
had been told from father to son, and so remembered. But
during the slavery in Egypt this instruction had been forgotten
by many, until they had become like the heathen around
them.</p>

<p>During their journey God had spoken to Israel only
through Moses. But at this time all the people were called
together, and God spoke His law to them with His own voice.</p>

<p>The scene which the people saw was terribly grand.
There was a thick cloud on the mount, and amidst it were
thunderings and lightnings. The whole mountain was shaken
with an earthquake.</p>

<p>There was a loud blast of a trumpet from the mount, "so
that all the people that was in the camp trembled." Then
God spake His law to the people,&mdash;the ten commandments
recorded in Exodus 20:3-17.</p>

<p>The children of Israel were always to remember this
scene. It was to impress upon their minds the greatness and
power of God, the importance of His law, and the necessity
of obeying it.</p>

<p>Moses was called up into the very presence of God, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
top of the mountain. Here God gave him two tables of stone
on which He had written with His finger the same ten commandments
that He had spoken in the hearing of all Israel.</p>

<p>God's law is as enduring as the stone on which it was
written. These two tables are called "the tables of the covenant."
Deuteronomy 9:11. The ten commandments are called
God's covenant with His people. "And He wrote upon the
tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments."
Exodus 34:28.</p>

<p>David said that His covenant, or law, was "commanded to
<i>a thousand generations</i>." Psalms 105:8. It will <i>continue forever</i>.
Christ Himself said, "Till heaven and earth pass, one
jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law."
Matthew 5:17, 18.</p>

<p>Again He said, "Whosoever therefore shall break one of
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall
be called the least (or, of no account) in the kingdom of
heaven." Matthew 5:19.</p>

<p>The Apostle James said, "For whosoever shall keep the
whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
James 2:10. Keeping nine of the commandments will not
save us. If we break <i>one</i> commandment, the law will condemn
us as surely as if we broke all the ten.</p>

<p>Man can not change <i>one single commandment</i> of God's law.
If he tries to do so, it is then only a commandment of men.
The worship of those who make or keep such commandments
is useless, for God will not accept it. Christ said of those
who do so, "But in vain do they worship Me, teaching for
doctrines the commandments of men." Matthew 15:9.</p>

<p>The only safe course is to take God's law <i>just as He gave
it</i> on Sinai, and obey it <i>as</i> He gave it. Of those who will be
alive when Christ comes it is written, "Here are they that
keep the commandments of God." Revelation 14:12.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Heaven will be filled with commandment-keeping people;
for it is written, "Blessed are they that do His commandments,
that they may have right to the tree of life, and may
enter in through the gates into the city." Revelation 22:14.</p>

<p>We can not keep these commandments ourselves any more
than the children of Israel could in the wilderness. It is for
this that Christ died on Calvary. Through Him we can have
forgiveness for our sins, and receive help to overcome sin and
obey the law of God.</p>

<p>While Moses was in the mount God gave him instructions
for building the sanctuary. It was to be like the one in
heaven. In it the Lord would meet His people and give
them such instruction as they needed. Provision was also
made in it for sacrifices and offerings, all of which were to
show their faith in the Saviour to come.</p>

<p>Moses was in the mountain one-ninth of a year. The
faith of the people was not strong enough to endure the long
separation from their leader. They did not think he would
return to them. They said, "As for this Moses, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we wot
not what has become of him."</p>

<p>They came to Aaron and said to him, "Up, make us gods,
which shall go before us." They would make to themselves a
calf as their leader to take the place of Moses, and then go
on to the promised land without him. The old habits of idol
worship in Egypt had come back to them.</p>

<p>So Israel brought their ornaments of gold to Aaron, and
he made of them a golden calf. The calf represented Apis,
the god held most sacred by the Egyptians.</p>

<p>When it was done the people gathered around it and
cried, "These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up
out of the land of Egypt." Exodus 32:4.</p>

<p>How could they so soon forget the wonders and plagues
brought by the Lord upon Egypt! How could they forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the terrible day when God spake to them His law from the
top of Mount Sinai!</p>

<p>And the Lord said to Moses, "Get thee down, for thy
people have corrupted themselves." As Moses came in sight
of the camp of Israel, and saw their heathen worship, he was
filled with horror and anger.</p>

<p>In his hands he bore the tables of the sacred law which
they were transgressing. He threw them down, and they were
broken in pieces at the foot of the mount.
This was to remind the Israelites that
they had broken God's law which
they had promised to obey. In
consequence of this they could not
claim the promise He had made
them.</p>

<p>Through the pleading of
Moses, God spared Israel at
this time, but the rebellion
and evil must be put away
from among them.</p>

<p>Moses called for a
separation in the camp.
Some had not joined in the
idolatry, but through it all had
remained true to God. These
were asked to take their place at the right hand of Moses.
Many others saw how wicked they had been, and repented.
These took their stand at the left.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/illus133.jpg" width="388" height="500" alt="Moses breaking tablets" />
<div class="caption">Moses Breaking the Tables of the Law.</div>
</div>
<p>Others were stubborn and would not repent, and would
not come by the side of Moses at all. About three thousand
of the leaders in wickedness perished at the command of the
Lord, and the camp was cleansed.</p>

<p>Aaron confessed his sin in making the golden calf, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was forgiven. The calf was ground to powder and scattered
in the waters of the brook from which they drank.</p>

<p>At the command of God, Moses hewed out two more tables
of stone, and took them up to
Sinai. On these God again
wrote His law. When the
sanctuary was completed,
these tables were placed
in a beautiful ark, overlaid
with gold. For this
reason it was called "The
Ark of the Covenant."</p>

<p>This ark was the most
sacred thing in all the
earthly sanctuary.
It was sacred
because it
contained the
tables on which
God had written
His law. It was
deposited in the
most holy place,
into which none
but the high
priest ever entered.</p>

<p>On the top of
the ark was the mercy seat, and here was where the glory
of God rested, and from this place He spake to His people.</p>

<p>When the children of Israel were taken captive by the
Babylonians, the ark disappeared, and the Bible makes no
mention of it since that time.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>AFTER</span> all the work on the tabernacle was
done, the Israelites again took up their
march toward the promised land. In eleven
days they reached Kadesh, near the borders
of Canaan.</p>

<p>Here twelve spies&mdash;one from each tribe&mdash;were
sent to view the land. They were gone forty days,
and on their return brought samples of the fruit of Canaan.
They brought one cluster of grapes, so large that it was carried
on a pole between two of the men.</p>

<p>In their report to Moses they said, "We came unto the
land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk
and honey; and this is the fruit of it." Numbers 13:17.</p>

<p>Oh, if they had only been willing to stop there in their
report! But they went on to tell that the land was filled
with strong nations. There were walled cities that could not
be broken down, and there were giants, the sons of Anak.</p>

<p>Then Israel lost all hope and courage, "And all the congregation
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cried; and the people wept that night." And
they murmured against Moses and Aaron, and said, "Would
God we had died in Egypt! or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the wilderness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Let us return to Egypt." Numbers 14:2, 4.</p>

<p>Where now was their faith and trust in God? They had
forgotten the wonders and plagues and the deliverance from
Egypt. They had forgotten the many times God had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
wonderful things for them on their journey. Surely a God
who could do such things could give them the victory over
their enemies in Canaan.</p>

<p>Only two of the twelve spies kept their faith in God.
Caleb and Joshua told the people that God was able to give
them the land. "And Caleb said, Let us go up at once, and
possess it; for we are well able to overcome it." Numbers
13:30. But the people would not listen to them.</p>

<p>Then God spake to Moses, and told him that Israel had
been so rebellious that those who came out of Egypt should
never enter the land of promise. They should wander in the
wilderness forty years until they died, and when their children
were grown He would bring them into the land.</p>

<p>But Caleb and Joshua had been faithful to God. These
two were excepted, and of all the men that left Egypt, only
these two should finally enter Canaan. The other ten spies,
who had caused Israel to sin, were smitten by the plague, and
died in the sight of all Israel.</p>

<p>All the next night Israel spent in mourning. They now
realized what they had lost. But in the morning a new hope
came to them. They would make up for their lack of courage.
They would now go up and take the land.</p>

<p>The armies of Israel gathered, but Moses said to them, "Go
not up, for the Lord is not among you." They had lost their
opportunity, and if they went up God would not fight for them.</p>

<p>But the army of Israel was a vast multitude of over half
a million solders. They now felt able to attack their enemies.
So against the command of God they went up to battle with
the armies of the Canaanites that had come out to meet them.</p>

<p>But the ark of God remained in camp, and so did Moses and
Aaron, Caleb and Joshua. Without a leader, and forsaken of
God, the army of Israel was defeated with great slaughter.</p>

<p>Then the Israelites turned back to the wilderness.</p>

</div>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>THE</span> Israelites wandered in the wilderness nearly
forty years. Then, at the command of the Lord,
they again turned their faces toward Canaan.</p>

<p>On this journey they were permitted to meet
many difficulties, that their faith and trust in God
might be tested. They were sometimes short of food to eat and
water to drink, and as they neared the promised land great
armies came out to destroy them. But the Lord helped them
in every trouble, and gave them the victory over their enemies.</p>

<p>Part of their way lay through a hot, sandy desert, where
they suffered from heat and thirst. But, instead of being patient,
they rebelled against God, and found fault with Moses.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/illus138.jpg" width="360" height="500" alt="Moses holding up serpent on stick" />
<div class="caption">The Brazen Serpent.</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Lord let serpents come into the camp, whose bite
was like fire, and brought sure death. Some in almost every
tent were bitten.</p>

<p>This punishment showed them their sin, and they came to
Moses and said, "We have sinned, for we have spoken against
the Lord, and against thee. Pray unto the Lord that He take
away the serpents from us." Numbers 21:7-9.</p>

<p>In answer to the prayer of Moses the Lord told him to make
a serpent of brass, and raise it up on a pole, so that all in the
camp could see it. Those who were bitten were told to look
at this Serpent and they would be healed. The serpent could
not heal them, but to look required faith, and faith brought the
healing power.</p>

<p>The Lord could have healed them with a word, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a><br /><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
lesson must be complete. The lifting up of the serpent was to
them a type of the lifting up of Christ on the cross, for through
Him only could they receive pardon and relief from the consequences
of sin. The brazen serpent was an object lesson to
lead the children of Israel to look to Christ.</p>

<p>The Hebrews had the same Gospel, or good news of pardon
and salvation through Christ, that we have. Speaking of them
in the wilderness, the Apostle Paul says, "For unto us was the
Gospel preached as well as unto them." Hebrews 4:2.</p>

<p>Every sacrifice they made for sin, every lamb slain, was to
show their faith in "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world." John 1:29. The blood of the offering was
a type of the blood of Christ.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ is the great central figure of the Gospel. It
was Christ who was with Israel in all their journey from Egypt
to the promised land.</p>

<p>Christ was the "Spiritual Rock" which followed them. He
was in the pillar of cloud by day, and in the pillar of fire by
night. He was the "Angel" that went before Israel; for
Jehovah said, "My name is in Him." (See Exodus 23:21, 22.)
No being bears the name of God but His Son.</p>

<p>So, in the history of the world, it has not been as some
have supposed, God the Father in the Old Testament, and
Christ the Son in the New Testament. It has been Christ
with His people all the way.</p>

<p>In the Old Testament Christ was their "Spiritual Rock."
In the New Testament, "God was in Christ, reconciling the
world unto Himself." 2 Corinthians 5:19.</p>

<p>Both the Father and the Son have ever worked for the
salvation of man; but Christ has been the active agent in this
work. It was God who "so loved the world that He gave His
only begotten Son" for our redemption. It was Christ who
made the terrible sacrifice for our salvation.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>AS</span> Israel neared the promised land, both Moses
and Aaron died. Joshua was then made commander
in the place of Moses.</p>

<p>Soon they came to the River Jordan, which
they must cross. Here again the Lord made a
way for them. He told Israel to go forward, and as the feet
of the leaders touched the water, the river stopped flowing from
above, and the bed of the stream was left dry. Then the people
passed over on dry ground, as their fathers had crossed the Red
Sea forty years before.</p>

<p>The book of Joshua tells of the battles that Israel fought
with the inhabitants of the land of Canaan. These were very
wicked nations, who were as bad as the people who lived before
the flood. So the Lord used the armies of Israel to destroy
those wicked people.</p>

<p>The first city overthrown was Jericho. This city had very
strong and high walls, and the Hebrews were not able to break
them down. But the Lord could do what man could not.</p>

<p>One day Joshua saw a man near the camp, with a sword
drawn in his hand. "And Joshua went unto him and said,
Art thou for us or for our adversaries?</p>

<p>"And he said, Nay; but as Captain of the host of the Lord
am I come." Joshua 5:13-15. Then Joshua knew that it was
Jesus Christ, for He is the Captain of the Lord's host.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lord told Joshua what to do. Each day, for six days,
all the army of Israel was to march around the city. The
soldiers were to go ahead, the priests with the ark of God were
to come next, and all the rest of the people were to follow.</p>

<p>On the seventh day they marched around the city seven
times. "And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the
priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people,
Shout; for the Lord hath given you the city." Joshua 6:16.</p>

<p>And when the people shouted, the walls of Jericho "fell
down flat," and the soldiers went into the city and utterly destroyed
it as the Lord had told them to do. This was to show
to all nations that God was fighting for Israel.</p>

<p>The tenth chapter of Joshua also tells of a very wonderful
battle between Israel and five of the kings of Canaan. All
day the battle lasted, and God fought for Israel, sending down
great hailstones upon their enemies. More were killed by these
hailstones than were slain by the Israelites.</p>

<p>As the conflict raged, Joshua saw that the day would be too
short to finish the battle. Then, led by the Spirit of God, he
commanded the sun and moon to stand still until the work
should be fully done.</p>

<p>"So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted
not to go down about a whole day. And there was no day
like that before it or after it." Joshua 10:13, 14.</p>

<p>In this battle the armies of the wicked Canaanites were
utterly destroyed, and their kings slain.</p>

<p>When the nations of Canaan were fully conquered, the
land was divided up and given to the different tribes of Israel,
as their home.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>AFTER</span> the death of Joshua, Israel
was governed by judges
for many hundred years. Sometimes these
judges were wicked men, and led the people
into the worship of idols.</p>

<p>Then the Lord, although He still loved
them, allowed their enemies to afflict them, that they might
remember that He alone could save them from their foes and
from sin.</p>

<p>Then when they returned to Him, confessed their sins, and
put away their idols, He would choose good and wise men to
be their judges. He would then go with their armies to battle,
defeat their enemies, and deliver them.</p>

<p>At one time the armies of Midian afflicted Israel for seven
years. At harvest time they would come "as grasshoppers for
multitude," and take from Israel "all the increase of the
earth." During these attacks the people fled to the dens, and
caves, and strongholds of the mountains.</p>

<p>Then Israel cried to the Lord for help, and He raised up
Gideon to deliver them. One day an angel appeared to him,
as he was threshing grain in secret for fear of the invaders.
And the angel told him that he was chosen to "save Israel
from the hand of the Midianites."</p>

<p>Gideon then prepared food and brought it to the angel.
He also asked for a sign that he might know that the words
spoken by the angel came from the Lord. So instead of eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the food, the angel said to Gideon, "Take the flesh and
the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour
out the broth."</p>

<p>When Gideon had done as he was told, the angel touched
the food with the rod in his hand, and fire came out of the
rock and burned it. Then the angel disappeared, and Gideon
knew that it was the Lord who had spoken to him.</p>

<p>And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he made
a call for soldiers. But before he dared take command of the
army that gathered, he asked for other signs that he might be
sure that God had really chosen him and would go with him.</p>

<p>So one night he spread a fleece of wool on the floor, and
asked the Lord that if He had chosen him to lead Israel, to
let dew fall on the fleece, and the rest of the floor be dry.
And in the morning he found it so.</p>

<p>The next night he asked that the dew might fall on the
floor and dampen it, and the fleece remain dry. This also was
done. Then Gideon knew that the Lord had called him to lead
the armies of Israel.</p>

<p>Gideon's army numbered only thirty-two thousand men, but
their enemies were "like grasshoppers for multitude." Yet the
Lord told Gideon that his army was too large. The Lord
would show all Israel that He would deliver them if they would
trust him.</p>

<p>So Gideon was told to let all who were fearful go back to
their homes. As a result, twenty-two thousand men returned,
leaving only ten thousand.</p>

<p>Yet <i>these</i> were too many. The army must be so small that
every one would know that it was God alone who gave the
victory. So at the command of the Lord they were led to a
brook to drink.</p>

<p>Those who kneeled down and drank were sent home. But
there were three hundred men whose thoughts were only on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the work before them. They dipped up the water in their
hands, and drank as they went on, with their faces toward the
enemy.</p>

<p>These three hundred men were then armed for their work,
and in a strange manner. Each man was given a trumpet, a
pitcher, and a blazing torch hidden in the pitcher. This little
army was then divided into three companies, and, in the darkness
of night, approached the hosts of Midian from three sides.</p>

<p>At a signal from Gideon, all three companies gave a blast
of their trumpets to awaken the sleeping enemy. Then they
broke the pitchers and let their torches flame up, and gave the
battle cry,&mdash;"The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon." To the
Midianites it appeared that they were surrounded by a great
army.</p>

<p>In their fear they fled for life. They mistook their own
companions for enemies, and killed one another. The news of
the victory spread, and thousands of Israel joined in pursuit of
their retreating foes, and the great army of Midianites was
utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>The strongest and most wonderful Judge of Israel was
Samson. According to instruction given his mother from the
Lord, he was a "Nazarite" from his birth. This meant that
he was to drink no wine, and the hair of his head was never
to be cut.</p>

<p>As he grew up, the Lord gave him wonderful strength.
One day as he was passing through a vineyard of the Philistines,
a young lion met him. He had no weapons with him,
but with his bare hands he tore the lion and killed him.</p>

<p>Soon after this a great army of Philistines came out against
Israel. "And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
Samson." His only weapon was the jaw bone of an ass; but
with this he defeated the whole army of the Philistines, and
slew a thousand of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was another lesson of what the Lord could do for His
people. Gideon had three hundred men when he fought the
hosts of Midian; but at this time one man alone won the
battle against an army of the Philistines.</p>


<p>At another time Samson stayed part of a night in a city
of the Philistines, called Gaza. And the dwellers in Gaza shut
the gates, and set men to watch them, so that when he should
come out they might kill him.</p>

<p>But before morning Samson arose, tore down the great
gate of the city, carried it on his shoulders to a hill, and left
it there.</p>

<p>All the wonderful things that Samson did, and how he
finally died, a prisoner to the Philistines, are recorded in
Judges 13-16.</p>

<div class="caption">The Child Samuel.</div>
</div>
<p>About fifty years after Samson's death, Samuel was born,
who was to be both a judge and a prophet.
His mother was a good woman. The Bible
says, she "lent him to the Lord as long as
he liveth." 1 Samuel 11:28.</p>

<p>Eli was priest at this time in the
temple of the Lord, and "the child Samuel
ministered unto the Lord before Eli."</p>

<p>While Samuel was a small boy, it came
to pass one night, ere the lamp of God
went out in the temple of the Lord, where
the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid
down to sleep, that the Lord called Samuel,
and he answered, "Here am I," thinking Eli had called him.</p>

<p>Three times this occurred. Then Samuel said, "Speak,
Lord; for Thy servant heareth."</p>

<p>Let us answer the Lord as did Samuel. He speaks to each
of us in His word, the Bible.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>UNTIL</span> the days of Samuel, Israel was not governed
by kings. Jehovah had promised to be
their Ruler and King. Had they been true
to Him they would have been prospered and
given every needed blessing.</p>

<p>But the people wanted to be like the nations around them.
So the elders came to Samuel and said, "Make us a king to
judge us like all the nations."</p>

<p>Samuel was a prophet of the Lord, and had been the judge of
Israel for many years. Their demand for a king displeased
him, for he felt that the people had rejected him.</p>

<p>But the Lord told Samuel to do as they asked, "for they
have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me." And the
Lord chose Saul, of the tribe of Benjamin, to be king.</p>

<p>At the command of the Lord, Samuel anointed Saul as
king. A little later he called the people together and presented
their new-made king to them. And they shouted, "God
save the king!"</p>

<p>But Saul soon became proud, and many times refused to
obey the Lord. Then the Lord rejected Saul and chose
David, a young shepherd boy, to be king when Saul should
die. And Samuel anointed David to be king in the place of
Saul.</p>

<div class="caption">David and Saul at the Cave.</div>
</div>

<p>When Saul heard of this he was very angry, and tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a><br /><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
many times to kill David. Saul wanted his son Jonathan to
be king when he died. How foolish it was for Saul to try to
kill David, when God had said he should be king over Israel!</p>

<p>So David fled from Saul, and for many years lived among
strangers, and in the dens and caves of the mountains. But
Saul hunted him so many times that David had to change his
hiding place very often.</p>

<p>One time Saul lay down to sleep in the very cave where
David was hidden, not knowing he was there. Some of the
men who were with David wanted him to kill Saul, but he
would not do it. He only crept up to the king and cut off a
piece of the robe which he wore.</p>

<p>When the king had gone, David called to him and showed
him the piece he had cut from his garment. Saul saw at once
that David could have killed him as easily as he cut a piece
from his garment.</p>

<p>Then Saul promised David that he would not again try to
destroy him. But David did not trust his promises; and it
was well he did not, for Saul was soon hunting him as wickedly
as before.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding David was hated by Saul, his son Jonathan
loved David. They were as brothers to each other. Jonathan
was a true servant of God. He was always true to David, and
whenever he could aid him in escaping from his father, he did
so, notwithstanding he knew that David was to be made king
instead of himself. This shows that he was one of the most
generous and lovable characters recorded in the Bible.</p>

<p>Finally there was a great battle between Saul's army and
the Philistines. In this battle Jonathan was slain, and Saul
fell on his own sword and killed himself.</p>

<p>Soon after this David was made king. In most things he
was a good king, and obeyed the Lord and ruled Israel well.
He was a great warrior, and subdued the enemies of his people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>At the death of David, his son Solomon was made king.
He was a very wise man and a good king. It was he who built
at Jerusalem the wonderful temple for the service of the Lord.</p>

<p>The wisdom and riches of Solomon were so wonderful that
his fame was spread abroad in all the earth. And the queen
of Sheba, in Arabia, came to see if all the reports she had
heard were true.</p>

<p>And the queen asked Solomon hard questions; but he was
able to answer every one of them. She was then shown the
riches and wonderful works of Solomon.</p>

<p>When ready to return to her own land she told Solomon
that she had heard wonderful reports about him and his kingdom,
but she had not believed them. Now, she said, "Mine
eyes have seen it; and, behold, the one-half of the greatness
of thy wisdom was not told me." 2 Chronicles 9.</p>

<p>After the days of Solomon, Israel was ruled by many kings.
Some of them were good, and their rule brought the blessing
of God to their people. But many were wicked men who led
Israel into sin and idolatry. Then the Lord could not protect
them, and their enemies would afflict them.</p>

<p>The history of Israel is a sorrowful story. God wanted to
bless them and make them the light of the world. He wanted
to show the whole world what wonderful things He would do
for those who were faithful to Him. But they preferred their
own way, and in consequence perished as a nation.</p>

<p>The apostle Paul says that "all these things happened unto
them for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition,
upon whom the ends of the world are come." 1 Corinthians
10:11.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory7'><span class='bgcolor'>AFTER</span> Samuel, the sixteen prophets whose writings
bear their names in the Bible, may be classified
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Those before Israel's Babylonian captivity,
namely: Jonah, Joel, Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah.</p>

<p>(2) Those near to, and during the captivity: Nahum,
Zephaniah, Habakkuk, Jeremiah, Daniel, Obadiah, Ezekiel.</p>

<p>(3) Those after the return from the captivity in Babylon:
Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi.</p>

<p>The books which bear these names in our Bible are not
arranged in the order in which they were written; but in the
order of their supposed importance. But man can not tell
which part of God's word is most valuable. "All scripture
is given by inspiration of God."</p>

<p>Peter says that "the prophecy came not in old time by
the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21.</p>

<p>We will refer to a few prophecies which have been fulfilled:</p>

<p>Isaiah mentions by name the Persian prince, Cyrus, 200
years before he was born, and tells what he should do. Compare
Isaiah 44:28 with Ezra 1:1, and notice the dates in the
margin of your Bible.</p>

<p>Isaiah also foretold and described the sufferings of Jesus.
Compare the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah with Luke 22:37;
John 1:10, 11; Matthew 8:17; 1 Peter 2:24, 25; Acts 8:32-38;
Luke 22:37; Matthew 27:57-60.</p>

<div class="caption">Daniel Interpreting the King's Dream.</div>
</div>
<p>Forty-seven of the sixty-six chapters in Isaiah are referred
to in the New Testament, and Jesus twice mentioned Isaiah by
name. Matthew 13:14; Matthew 15:37.</p>

<p>Jeremiah prophesied that Jerusalem
should be destroyed, and that during the
siege the famine should be so great that
the Jews should "eat the flesh
of their sons and the flesh
of their daughters." Jeremiah
19:9.</p>

<p>This prophecy
was given six hundred
and five years
before Christ, and
it was fulfilled
when the Roman
army surrounded
Jerusalem, <small>A. D.</small>
70, thirty-six
years after the
crucifixion of
Jesus.</p>

<p>Some of the
most wonderful of
the prophecies are
in the book of
Daniel. The history
of the world
since his time is given plainly in chapters two, seven and
eight.</p>

<p>In the second chapter the Lord foretold, by a dream, what
should come to pass from that time to the end of the world.</p>

<p>Daniel, a prophet of the Lord, was given wisdom to tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
king his dream, which he had forgotten, and also its meaning,
after the false prophets had confessed that they could not do so.</p>

<p>Daniel said: "There is a God in heaven that revealeth
secrets, and <i>maketh known</i> to the king Nebuchadnezzar what
shall be in the <i>latter days</i>." Daniel 2:28.</p>

<p>So the interpretation is for us, because "the secret things
belong unto the Lord our God; but <i>those things which are revealed
belong unto us and to our children</i>." Deuteronomy 29:29.</p>

<p>Prophecy is history told in advance. The Lord is the
only one who can do this without making a mistake.</p>

<p>Turn to Daniel 2:31-36, and read the dream. Verses 37
to 45 interpret it plainly, showing that the four parts of the
image mean four great kingdoms.</p>

<p>History tells us that the Babylonian kingdom, symbolized
by the head of gold, was conquered <small>B. C.</small> 538 (five hundred
and thirty-eight years before the time of Christ), by the Medo-Persians,
represented by the breast and arms of silver. Cyrus
was their general.</p>

<p>The Medo-Persians were overcome by the Grecians, under
Alexander, 331 <small>B. C.</small> The brass thighs of the image represent
their kingdom.</p>

<p>The Romans, "strong as iron," signified by the legs of
iron, subdued the Grecians in the year 168 <small>B. C.</small></p>

<p>The feet and toes of the image represent the ten parts into
which the Roman empire was divided between the years 351
and 476 after the birth of Christ.</p>

<p>These parts of Rome exist in Europe to-day, under the
names, England, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, etc., and will
continue separate (see verse 43) until the kingdom of Christ is
set up, represented by the stone "cut out of the mountain
without hands," which "shall break in pieces and consume all
these kingdoms, and shall stand for ever." Jesus said, "Blessed
are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."</p>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>THE</span> great Teacher said, "Love your enemies, bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully
use you." Matthew 5:9, 39-44.</p>

<p>When everybody does this, there will be no war. All will
be righteous; for "love is the fulfilling of the law," God's standard
of right-doing.</p>

<p>But no person can love everybody without a change of heart.
"Ye must be born again," said Jesus. This change, or new life, comes by <i>believing</i> that
God will change us. It is only when we stop believing right that we stop doing right.</p>

<p>If the world would believe, the world would be converted, or changed; but the parable
of the tares and the wheat (Matthew 13:36-43), and what Jesus said about the
"many" in the broad way and the "few" in the narrow way (Matt. 7:13, 14), show
that "many are called, but few chosen."</p>

<p>Yet thousands of people are prophesying "peace and safety" (1 Thessalonians 5:1-5),
forgetting that "evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being
deceived" (2 Timothy 3:13), and that the "tares," or sinners, are finally to be destroyed
instead of being changed over into wheat. "Ye will not come unto Me," said Jesus.</p>

<p>One of the prophecies of Isaiah (2:2-5) says that "many people" "in the last days"
shall talk about peace as if it were coming soon by the conversion of the world. The
marginal reading of Isaiah 2:16, calls such talk "pictures of desire," and says they
shall "be brought low" (verse 12).</p>

<p>Verses three to five tell what the "<i>people</i>" are saying. Verses six to twenty-two are
the <i>prophet's</i> declarations because of what the people have said. He foretells destruction
for those who do not repent, the same as does the prophet Joel. It will be a time of general
war. Here are the <i>people's</i> sayings and the <i>Lord's</i> sayings, side by side. They are
direct opposites; yet both refer to "the last days," when "the day of the Lord is near:"</p>

<p>"It shall come to pass in <i>THE LAST DAYS</i> that
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>MANY PEOPLE</i> shall say, Come ye, and let
us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house
of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his
ways, and we will walk in his paths:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"And he shall judge among the nations, and shall
rebuke many people: and they shall beat their
swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks:
nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>

<p>"O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the
light of the Lord." Isaiah 2:2-5.</p>

<p>Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles. Prepare
war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of
war draw near; let them come up:</p>

<p>"Beat your plowshares into swords, and your
pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say I am
strong.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is
ripe: come, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for their <small>WICKEDNESS</small> is great.</p>

<p>"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision:
for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision."
Joel 3:9-16.</p>

<p>The <i>DAY OF THE LORD</i> "shall come as <i>A DESTRUCTION</i>
from the Almighty." Isaiah 13:6-11.</p>

</div>

<p>In ancient times, when a king made a visit to another
country, he sent messengers before him. These messengers
would see that there was a good path for him to travel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a><br /><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that the people where he was going were ready to receive him.</p>

<p>John the Baptist was God's messenger, sent to arouse the
people of this world, and prepare them to receive Jesus when
He should come to visit them.</p>

<p>Before Jesus came to this earth He was a great King in
heaven. Paul says He was "equal with God." Philippians
2:6.</p>

<p>We can never understand how the Son of God, the great
King of heaven, could come to this earth as a babe. This
is one of God's great mysteries.</p>

<p>But he did come in just this way. He was born in a
manger in Bethlehem. Coming in this humble manner, the
priests and rulers of Israel were not ready to receive this Babe
as their Saviour. They were looking for Him to come as a
great King, in pomp and splendor.</p>

<p>But there were on the plains of Bethlehem some humble
shepherds who were looking and waiting for the promised
Messiah. To them angels were sent to tell of the birth of
Jesus.</p>

<p>And the angel said, "Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
swaddling clothes, lying in a manger." And they went to
Bethlehem in haste, and found the infant Jesus as the angel
had told them.</p>

<p>God meant that others, as well as the Jews, should know
that the Saviour had come to begin His work on earth. Away
off in the Eastern country there were wise men who had read
the prophecies about the Messiah, and believed that He would
soon appear.</p>

<p>One night these men saw a wonderfully bright star in the
sky, moving toward the land of Judea. They believed this
to be a sign that the Messiah had come. So they followed the
star, and it brought them to the manger in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>"And when they were come into the house, they saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
young child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped
Him; and when they had
opened their treasures, they presented
unto Him gifts; gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh.</p>

<p>"And being warned of God in
a dream that they should not
return to Herod, they departed into
their own country another
way.</p>

<p>"And when they were
departed, behold, the
angel of the Lord
appeareth to
Joseph in a
dream, saying,
Arise, and
take the
young child
and His mother,
and flee
into Egypt,
and be thou
there until I
bring thee
word: for Herod
will seek
the young
child to destroy
Him."</p>

<p>Find the second chapter of Matthew, and read about the flight
into Egypt, and why they finally went to Nazareth, in Galilee,
instead of to a city of Judea. Verses 15 and 23 tell the reason.</p>

</div>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>THE</span> early life of Jesus was spent in Nazareth,
a small city in the northern part
of Palestine. His parents were very poor, and He
had only what poor children have.</p>

<p>His father was a carpenter, and Christ learned
the carpenter's trade and worked with him. From
His earliest days He was a pattern of obedience and
industry. He was used to a life of hardship and toil, and can
comfort all those who must work for a living.</p>

<p>Of the childhood of Jesus it is written, "The child grew,
and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace
of God was upon Him." Luke 2:40.</p>

<p>The mother of Jesus was His first earthly teacher. From
her lips, and by reading the prophecies, He was taught of
heavenly things and of His mission to this world.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus168.jpg" width="500" height="358" alt="Jesus in the temple" />
<div class="caption">\Jesus among the Teachers of the Law.</div>
</div>
<p>The wonderful truths which He Himself had spoken to
Moses and the prophets, He was now taught by His mother.
The Holy Spirit gave her wisdom to teach Him aright. All
parents should teach their children as Jesus was taught, that
every child may obtain knowledge as Jesus did.</p>

<p>Jesus left all His glory and power when He came to earth
as a babe. He took His place by the side of the fallen men
of earth. He came "in the likeness of sinful flesh." He was
subject to all the temptations and weakness of our fallen race.</p>

<img src="images/illus169.jpg" width="295" height="400" alt="Jesus and Joseph working" />
<div class="caption">Jesus in the Carpenter Shop.</div>
</div>

<p>Yet by the power of God He was kept from yielding to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a><br /><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the temptations which surrounded Him. This power He
gained by earnest prayer to His Father in Heaven. This
power every child and man can obtain in the same way.</p>

<p>In His humble life, as the child of poor parents, He faithfully
did His part of the work. Ever obedient and cheerful,
He was as a pleasant sunbeam
in the home circle.</p>

<p>Once a year His parents
went up to Jerusalem to attend
the passover. When Jesus was
twelve years of age He went up
with them.</p>

<p>When the feast was over,
Joseph and Mary started for
home with a company of
friends, but Jesus remained
in Jerusalem. They supposed
He was in the company,
and did not miss Him
until they had journeyed a
whole day. Then they
turned back to find Him.</p>



<p>"And it came to pass, that
after three days, they found
Him in the temple, sitting in
the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and
asking them questions." Luke 2:46. These doctors were
learned men in the Scriptures, yet they were astonished at
the questions and answers of Jesus. They soon saw that He
had a deeper knowledge of the Word of God than they had,
although He was so young.</p>

<p>Jesus seemed to know the Scriptures from beginning to end.
He repeated them in such a way that their true meaning shone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
out. His knowledge of the Scriptures made them ashamed.</p>

<p>"Though Christ seemed like a child that was seeking help
from those who knew a great deal more than He did, yet He
was bringing light to their minds in every word He spoke."
While appearing to instruct Jesus, these doctors were asking
questions and learning Bible truths which they did not
understand.</p>

<p>And while Jesus was thus teaching others, "He Himself
was receiving light and knowledge about His own work and
mission in the world; for it is plainly stated that Christ 'grew
in knowledge.'"</p>

<p>When Mary found Him she said, "Son, why hast Thou
thus dealt with us? Behold, Thy father and I have sought
Thee sorrowing." And Jesus answered, "How is it that ye
sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's
business?"</p>

<p>His parents could not understand Him then, but when He
began His ministry it was plain to them.</p>

<p>"And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and
was subject unto them; but His mother kept all these sayings
in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and
in favor with God and man." Luke 2:41-53.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>WHEN</span> Jesus was about thirty years of age, He
went to be baptized by John in the River Jordan.
He was not baptized because He was a
sinner, but to set an example for all to follow.</p>

<p>When He came out of the water the Holy
Spirit, in the form of a dove, descended from Heaven
upon Him. Then the voice of God was heard, saying
"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</p>

<p>The descent of the dove upon Christ was His anointing
for the work of the ministry that was before Him. From the
Jordan the Spirit led Him into the wilderness, where He
fasted forty days, and where the devil tempted Him in many
ways, as recorded in Matthew 4:1-11.</p>

<p>From the wilderness He returned to the Jordan, and began
to choose His disciples. We next hear of Him at the marriage
at Cana of Galilee, where He performed the wonderful
miracle of turning water into wine.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Jesus went to Jerusalem to attend the feast
of the passover. As He entered the temple where God was
worshiped, He found the court filled with cattle, sheep, and
birds, for sale to those who would buy sacrifices for their sins.</p>

<p>Cheating and robbery were carried on in the very temple
court. Even priests and rulers were engaged in this unholy
traffic. As Jesus stands on the temple steps His eye views
the whole scene. His countenance changes, and all seem
compelled to look upon Him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>All trading ceased, and there was silence in the temple
court. Then, raising a whip of small cords, He cried, "Take
these things hence; make not My Father's house an house of
merchandise." John 2:16.</p>

<p>Priests, and rulers, and merchants fled in terror from the
temple. They could not endure the look on His face nor the
power of His voice. The divine power had flashed through
the humanity of Christ.</p>

<p>After a time the crowd that had fled at the words of Jesus
came slowly back; but what a change had taken place! Instead
of unholy trade, they saw the Saviour healing the sick
who were pressing around Him.</p>

<p>On every side was heard the urgent, pitiful appeals, "Master,
bless me." All were healed who came to Him. The lame
were made to walk, the dumb to speak, and the blind to see.</p>

<p>The mothers brought their children to be healed and blessed.
The little sufferers were returned to their mother's arms with
the bloom of health and the smile of happiness on their faces.</p>

<p>Jesus loved the children because they were so pure and
innocent and simple in their ways. He took them as an example
of the purity and simplicity that should show in the
lives of those who should follow Him.</p>

<p>One day some mothers brought their children to Jesus, hoping
that He would bless them. But He had worked a long
time, and needed rest. So His disciples rebuked the mothers,
and told them not to trouble the Master.</p>

<p>"But when Jesus saw it, He was much displeased, and said
unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid
them not; for of such is the kingdom of God." Mark 10:14.</p>

description of this scene:&mdash;</p>

<p class='dropcapstory6'><span class='bgcolor'>ON</span> earth Jesus had no home of His own. He
said of Himself, "The foxes have holes, and the
birds of the air have nests; but the Son of
man hath not where to lay His head." See
Matthew 8:20.</p>

<p>He never remained long in one place. We read of His
beautiful teachings and wonderful miracles in all parts of Palestine.
At one time He is on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.
At another time He is in Jerusalem, cleansing the temple and
healing the sick. Then He is by Jacob's well, in Samaria,
teaching the people of Sychar the way to everlasting life.</p>

<p>He had no home of His own, but many were glad to
receive Him as a loved and honored guest. When in these
homes He more than repaid them for their care, by the beautiful
lessons He taught, and the sorrows He comforted.</p>

<p>And we can have Jesus in our homes to-day just as truly
as they had Him when He was on earth. If we invite Him,
He will come into our homes and dwell with us, and teach us,
and help us in all our trials, and comfort us in all our sorrows.</p>

<p>In the little town of Bethany, near Jerusalem, was the
home of Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha. At this
pleasant home the Saviour was always welcome. This whole
family believed in Jesus and His mission, and eagerly listened
to the words which He spake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>In this peaceful home Jesus often found rest. When
weary, and feeling the need of human sympathy, He was glad
to escape from the throngs of people, and the contentions of
the wicked Pharisees, for the quiet and peace of this humble
home.</p>

<p>At the time of His first visit to Bethany, His disciples
came with Him to the home of Lazarus. Here He had no
enemies to watch his words, and He taught the great truths
of the gospel plainly, and not in parables.</p>

<p>Prizing these lessons, Mary sat at the feet of Jesus, an eager
listener to the wonderful words of life. But Martha was busy
preparing food for the guests. She was very anxious that
they should be comfortably cared for.</p>

<p>Martha felt that her sister was not helping in the work as
she ought, and came to Christ, and said, "Lord, dost Thou
not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her
therefore that she help me."</p>

<p>But Jesus answered, "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and
troubled about many things; but one thing is needful; and
Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken
away from her." Luke 10:40, 41.</p>

<p>The most important thing in this world is to learn the
great lessons which Jesus teaches. There is need for the
Marthas with their zeal and carefulness for the work and servants
of God. But first they should, like Mary, learn at the
feet of Jesus.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory7'><span class='bgcolor'>DURING</span> His mission on earth, Jesus performed many
wonderful miracles. He healed the sick, gave
sight to the blind, made the deaf to hear,
cleansed the lepers, raised the dead, stilled the
storm, and did many other wonderful works.</p>

<p>At one time Jesus had been teaching all day in a desert
place. As the night came on the disciples asked Him to send
the people away that they might go into the villages and buy
food to eat.</p>

<p>But Jesus answered, "Give ye them to eat." They were
astonished at this, for there were five thousand people to be
fed, and they had only five loaves and two small fishes.</p>

<p>Then Jesus took the loaves and fishes and blessed them,
and divided them among the people. "And they did all eat,
and were filled. And they took up twelve baskets full of the
fragments, and of the fishes," Mark 6:39-44</p>

<p>At another time four of the disciples fished all night on
the Lake of Gennesaret, or Galilee, and had caught nothing.
And Jesus said to Peter, "Launch out into the deep, and let
down your net for a draught."</p>

<p>But Peter was discouraged, and said, "Master, we have
toiled all the night and have taken nothing; nevertheless at
Thy word I will let down the net. And when they had this
done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their net
brake." Luke 5:1-7.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Peter and Andrew called to James and John to come
with their boat and help them. And both boats were filled
with the fish.</p>

<p>Some time after this miracle, Jesus and the disciples were
crossing this same lake, and a terrible storm arose. But Jesus
was lying asleep on one of the hard seats of the boat.</p>

<p>The disciples worked hard to save the boat; but when it
began to fill with water, they awoke Him, and said, "Master,
Master, we perish." And the Saviour rebuked the storm,
and it ceased, and the waters became still.</p>

<p>Every miracle performed by Jesus had a lesson for us.
These miracles show that the Lord can control every element
for the good of His people and work. They also show that
He can provide for all our wants.</p>

<p>Wherever Jesus went, the sick and the suffering were
brought to Him, and He never turned them away. By a
touch the blind received their sight. By a word the deaf
were made to hear, and the lame to walk.</p>

<p>To the appeal of the lepers He said, "I will, be thou
clean," and they were cured of their loathsome disease. At
His command the devils were cast out, and those having all
manner of diseases were healed.</p>

<p>All sickness and suffering are the result of sin. When
the same dear hand that healed the sick on earth shall destroy
sin, all sickness and suffering shall be forever ended.</p>

<p>Among the many miracles of Jesus, even the dead were
raised to life. The daughter of Jairus, a ruler in Israel, was
sick, and before Jesus reached her she died. Yet He took
her by the hand, and said, "Damsel, I say unto thee, arise."
And she was raised to life and perfect health. See Mark 5:22-43.</p>

<p>The son of the widow of Nain was raised from the dead
as he was being taken to the place of burial. See Luke 7:11-15.</p>

<div class="caption">The Mighty Healer.</div>
</div>
<p>But the greatest exhibition of divine power was in the raising
of Lazarus, who had been dead four days. He had been
dead so long that no one even thought of his being raised.</p>

<p>But when the stone was rolled
away, Jesus cried, "Lazarus, come
forth!" At the call of the Life-giver,
he that had
been dead came
to the door of
the sepulcher.
And Jesus said,
"Loose him,
and let him go."
These miracles
show
that Jesus
can break
the power of
death. When
He shall again
come to
this earth
He will bring
the final reward
to His
people. See
Revelation
22:12.</p>



<p>Paul based
his future hope on the resurrection. "For if the dead rise not,
then is not Christ raised; and if Christ be not raised, your
faith is vain, ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which
have fallen asleep in Christ are perished." 1 Cor. 15:16-18.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory7'><span class='bgcolor'>MUCH</span> of the teaching of our Saviour
was made plain by the use of parables,
or object lessons. He took the things of
every-day life, with which all were familiar,
to illustrate the truths of eternal life.</p>

<p>"And He spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</p>

<p>"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a
Pharisee, and the other a publican.</p>

<p>"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I
thank Thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners,
unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in
the week, I give tithes of all I possess.</p>

<p>"And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so
much as his eyes unto Heaven, but smote upon his breast,
saying, God be merciful to me a sinner." Luke 18:9-13.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/illus184.jpg" width="359" height="500" alt="praying to be seen and praying to be heard" />
<div class="caption">The Pharisee and the Publican</div>
</div>
<p>Our own righteousness is nothing but "filthy rags." Our
own good deeds can never save us. Prayer is simply coming
to God as our Father. It is telling Him of our needs, and
thanking Him for His blessings.</p>

<p>The Pharisee felt no need, and so received no blessing. The
publican knew he was a sinner, and asked for the mercy of
God. Hence he went from the temple forgiven, "justified,"
made just before God. His record was made clean on the
books of Heaven.</p>


<p>In another parable Jesus said, "There was a certain rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a><br /><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared
sumptuously every day.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/illus185.jpg" width="333" height="450" alt="rich man having poor man thrown out" />
<div class="caption">The Rich Man and Lazarus.</div>
</div>
<p>"And there was a certain beggar
named Lazarus, which was
laid at his gate, full of sores, and
desiring to be fed with the
crumbs which fell from the
rich man's table." See
Luke 16:19-31.</p>

<p>The rich
man died
and was punished,
because he had not
made God his hope
and trust. But Lazarus,
although poor and
afflicted, had been a
servant of the Most
High God. He also
died, but received
the glorious reward
which God has in
store for all who
obey Him.</p>

<p>This parable
teaches that riches
are no sign of
God's favor; neither
does poverty indicate
that one is
rejected of God. At another time a lawyer asked Jesus,
"Who is my neighbor?"</p>



<p>Jesus answered with a parable. A man traveling from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Jerusalem to Jericho was met by thieves, who beat him, and
robbed him, and left him, supposing he was dead.</p>

<p>A priest came that way, but passed
by on the other side of the road.
A Levite also came and looked
at him, and then went away
without giving aid. But at
last, one of the Samaritans
(a people despised by the
Jews) came along. When he
saw the wounded man, he
bound up his wounds,
lifted him onto
his beast,
took him to an
inn, and cared
for him.</p>

<p>Then Jesus
asked, "which
now of these
three, thinkest
thou, was
neighbor unto
him that
fell among
the thieves?"
And the lawyer
could only answer, "He that showed mercy on him."
Then Jesus said, "Go, and do thou likewise." See Luke 10:25-37.</p>

may be living out the principles taught by Christ,
better than the ones who despise him.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory7'><span class='bgcolor'>AFTER</span> three years and a half of ministry,
Jesus came to Jerusalem to eat the last passover.
From the supper room He went with His
disciples to the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus
knew that the time for His suffering and death
had now come, and He went to the garden for one last season
of prayer to His Father.</p>

<p>We can never understand the terrible sufferings of Christ
in Gethsemane. He was to suffer for the sins of the world.
He must feel the displeasure which God has for sin.</p>

<p>So great was His mental agony that drops of blood, like
sweat, stood upon His face. Three times He prayed to the
Father for strength and submission for the awful trial before
Him.</p>

<p>After each prayer He came to the disciples for sympathy;
but each time found them asleep. Had they watched and prayed
with the Master, they, too, would have received strength for
the trial and sorrow before them.</p>

<p>After the last prayer, He said to the disciples, "Rise, let
us be going; behold he is at hand that doth betray Me."
Matthew 26:45, 46. They were then met by the throng that
had come to take Jesus, and Judas betrayed His Master with
a kiss.</p>

<p>That same night Jesus was examined before the high priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a><br /><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and the Sanhedrim, and in the morning He was taken before
Pilate for condemnation. Pilate was a Roman governor, and
no one could be put to death unless he commanded it.</p>

<p>When Pilate saw Jesus, he did not believe he was a criminal.
He saw a man of noble, dignified bearing, with no appearance
of crime about Him.</p>

</div>
<p>But men had been hired by the priests to testify falsely
against Jesus. Pilate listened to them, and then questioned the
Saviour. He then gave his decision, "I find no fault in the
Man." Pilate wished to release Him: but the priests were determined
that he should be put to death.</p>

<p>Then Pilate sent Jesus bound to Herod, for Herod was ruler
of Galilee, and the home of Jesus had been in that country.
The soldiers mocked and derided Him, and then Herod sent
Him back to Pilate.</p>

<p>Pilate was angry when Jesus was brought back to Him for
final trial. So he said, "I will therefore chastise Him and let
Him go." But the priests would not consent, and all cried out,
"Away with this man." Nothing less than the death of Jesus
would pacify them.</p>

<p>At this time God sent a warning to Pilate. An angel
troubled the mind of Pilate's wife, and she sent word to her
husband, "Have thou nothing to do with that just Man; for
I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of
Him." Matthew 27:19.</p>

<p>But Pilate feared to displease the Jews. So he washed his
hands before the people, to show that he would not be responsible
for the death of Jesus. And yet Pilate condemned Him to
death, and He was taken to Calvary and crucified between
two thieves.</p>

<p>Tender, loving hands took Him down from the cruel cross,
and laid Him away in Joseph's new tomb. But the tomb could
not hold Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Early on the morning of the first day of the week, a
powerful angel was sent from the courts of Heaven. The
stone was rolled away from the tomb, and the
angel cried with a loud voice, "Jesus,
Thou Son of God, come forth, Thy Father
calls Thee!" And Christ came from
the tomb, a conquerer over sin, Satan,
death, and the grave.</p>

<p>When the women came that morning,
to care for the body of Jesus, they found
a shining angel
at the tomb.
And he said to
them, "Fear not
ye; for I know
that ye seek
Jesus, which
was crucified.</p>

<p>"He is not
here; for He is
risen, as He
said. Come and
see the place
where the Lord
lay. And go
quickly and tell
His disciples
that He is risen
from the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into Galilee;
there shall ye see Him; lo, I have told you.</p>




<p>"And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear
and great joy; and did run to bring His disciples word."
Matthew 28:1-8.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory5'><span class='bgcolor'>AFTER</span> the resurrection Jesus appeared
to His disciples at different times
and places. They were thus strengthened
for the work that was before them.</p>

<p>At His last visit, forty days after the resurrection,
He walked with them from Jerusalem to the Mount
of Olives. Here He gave the blessed promise, so
dear to every child of God, "Lo, I am with you alway,
even unto the end of the world." Matthew 28:20.</p>

<p>And then, with hands raised in blessing, He rose from
among them. As they gazed upward, "a cloud [of heavenly
angels] received Him out of their sight."</p>

<p>Had they lost their Saviour forever? Oh, no! Two shining
angels had been sent to comfort them, and said, "Ye men
of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into Heaven? this same
Jesus, which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so
come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into Heaven."
Acts 1:9-11.</p>

<p>Jesus Himself has said, "I will come again, and receive
you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."
John 14:1-3.</p>

<p>The angels told the disciples that He would "so come in
like manner as ye have seen Him go into Heaven." He ascended
bodily, in plain sight of the disciples. When He returns,
"every eye shall see Him." Revelation 1:7.</p>

<p>Paul, in describing Christ's second coming, says, "For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Lord Himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with
the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God; and
the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive
and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds,
to meet the Lord in the air; and
so shall we ever be with the
Lord." 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17.</p>

<p>Paul calls the Christian's hope
"that blessed hope, and the glorious
appearing of the great God
and our Saviour Jesus Christ."
Titus 2:13.</p>

<p>The hope of the Christian
depends on the second coming of
our Lord, for He says, "Behold,
I come quickly; and My reward
is with Me, to give every man
according as his work shall be."
Revelation 22:12.</p>

<p>Yes, Jesus is coming again.
And when He comes the righteous
dead will be raised from
their graves, and all that have
been faithful and true will be rewarded
with everlasting life in
the paradise of God.</p>

<p>The reward is worth receiving.
A beautiful crown is waiting; for Paul says, "Henceforth there
is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day; and not to
me only, but unto <i>all them also that love His appearing</i>."
2 Timothy 4:6-8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>This is called a "crown of life," in James 1:12, and Revelation
2:10. Peter calls it a "crown of glory," and says it
is to be given "when the Chief Shepherd shall appear." 1 Peter
5:4.</p>

<p>And this earth, cleansed and purified from sin and the
effects of the curse, is to be our home. Peter says of it, "Nevertheless
we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and
a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:10, 13.</p>

<p>The New Jerusalem, which Christ is preparing in heaven,
shall come down to earth and be its capital city. The apostle-prophet
John said he "saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming
down from God out of heaven."</p>

<p>"And I saw no temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty
and the Lamb are the temple of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Lamb is the light
thereof. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk
in the light of it."</p>

<p>"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed
away."</p>

<p>"He that overcometh shall inherit <i>all things;</i> and I will be
his God, and he shall be My son." Revelation 21:7.</p>

<p>The earth and the dominion of it were given to man at
creation. These will be restored to him at redemption.</p>

<p>The prophet Micah said to the "daughter of Zion, unto thee
shall it come, even the first dominion." Micah 4:8.</p>

<p>Then Eden lost will be Eden regained, and the lost dominion
will be</p>
